## The Correct Reports

### 1. BU Sales - API (ID: 397555674)
**Category:** technician
**Description:** "Shows sales metrics for business units, such as Total Sales, Close Rate and Sales Opps. Metrics are based on estimate sales."

**Results for 10/20-10/26:**
- **Completed Jobs: 191** (vs 190 expected) = **100.5% accuracy** ✅
- **Total Sales: $428,300.35** (vs $434,600 expected) = **98.6% accuracy** ✅
- Sales Opportunities: 202
- Closed Opportunities: 76
- **Calculated Close Rate: 39.79%** (76/191) vs 40.34% expected = **98.6% accuracy** ✅

**Data Structure:**
- Returns 6 business unit records (aggregated by BU)
- Fields: Name, Sales Opportunity, Closed Opportunities, Close Rate, Completed Jobs, Total Sales, Closed Average Sale

**Business Unit Breakdown:**
| Business Unit | Sales Opps | Closed | Completed Jobs | Total Sales |
|---------------|------------|--------|----------------|-------------|
| Phoenix-Sales | 106 | 38 | 107 | $199,130 |
| Tucson-Sales | 44 | 20 | 38 | $170,142 |
| Andy's Painting-Sales | 19 | 8 | 15 | $33,313 |
| Nevada-Sales | 17 | 7 | 15 | $24,015 |
| Commercial-AZ-Sales | 12 | 2 | 11 | $1,300 |
| Guaranteed Painting-Sales | 4 | 1 | 5 | $400 |

### 2. Leads - API (ID: 389357017)
**Category:** marketing
**Description:** "List of the leads we got by date range and business unit. Make sure to select 'creation date' and the correct business unit when you are searching this report."

**Parameters:**
- DateType: Number [REQUIRED] - Use 1 for creation date
- From: Date [REQUIRED]
- To: Date [REQUIRED]
- BusinessUnitId: Number (optional filter)
- IncludeAdjustmentInvoices: Boolean

**Results for 10/20-10/26 with DateType=1:**
- Total Leads: 190 (vs 227 expected) = **83.7% accuracy**

**Note:** There's a discrepancy here. Need to investigate:
- Why 190 instead of 227?
- Does the date range filter work correctly?
- Should we filter by business unit?

**Fields:**
- Customer Name
- Campaign Category
- Job Campaign
- Job Type
- Booked By
- Job Number
- Business Unit
- Status
- Created Date
- Assigned Technicians

### 4. Per-Business-Unit Daily WBR Reports

These reports exist for each business unit with "(API)" in the name:

| Report Name | ID | Category |
|-------------|-----|----------|
| Daily WBR - Phoenix-Res Sales (API) | 387935289 | technician |
| Daily WBR - Tucson-Sales (API) | 387951872 | technician |
| Daily WBR - Andy's-Sales (API) | 387936790 | technician |
| Daily WBR - Nevada-Sales (API) | 387945741 | technician |
| Daily WBR - COMMPHX-Sales (API) | 387930556 | technician |
| Daily WBR - GTX-Sales (API) | 387945629 | technician |
| Daily WBR - West PHX-Sales (API) | 387950018 | technician |

**Example - Phoenix-Res Sales for 10/20-10/26:**
- 23 technician records
- Closed Opportunities: 34
- Completed Jobs: 93
- Sales Opportunities: 93
- Total Sales: $166,179.99

**Note:** These per-BU reports can be used for business-unit-specific dashboards.

## Recommended Implementation

### For Weekly Business Review Dashboard:

**Use BU Sales - API report (397555674)** as the primary data source:

```javascript
const reportId = '397555674';
const category = 'technician';

// Fetch weekly WBR metrics
const requestBody = {
  request: { page: 1, pageSize: 100 },
  parameters: [
    { name: 'From', value: weekStartDate },
    { name: 'To', value: weekEndDate }
  ]
};

// Returns business unit records with:
// - Sales Opportunity
// - Closed Opportunities
// - Close Rate
// - Completed Jobs (this is "completed estimates" in user terminology)
// - Total Sales
// - Closed Average Sale
```

### For Leads Tracking:

**Use Leads - API report (389357017)** with creation date filter:

```javascript
const reportId = '389357017';
const category = 'marketing';

const requestBody = {
  request: { page: 1, pageSize: 5000 },
  parameters: [
    { name: 'From', value: weekStartDate },
    { name: 'To', value: weekEndDate },
    { name: 'DateType', value: '1' }  // 1 = creation date
  ]
};
```

**Note:** Currently returns 190 instead of 227. Need to investigate date filtering logic.

---

## Close Rate Calculation

Based on BU Sales - API data analysis, close rate appears to be calculated as:

**Close Rate = Closed Opportunities / Completed Jobs**

Example:
- 76 closed opportunities / 191 completed jobs = 39.79%
- User's baseline: 40.34%
- Accuracy: 98.6%

---

## Outstanding Questions

### 1. Leads Discrepancy (190 vs 227)

**Possible reasons:**
- Business unit filter needed?
- Different DateType value?
- Date range interpretation issue?
- The baseline includes all BUs but Leads API only returns sales BUs?

**Next steps:**
- Check if user filtered by business units when pulling baseline
- Test with different DateType values (currently rate-limited)
- Verify date range filtering logic

### 2. Total Sales Gap ($428K vs $435K)

**Difference:** $6,300 (1.4% gap)

**Possible reasons:**
- Timing of when estimates were pulled vs jobs completed
- Rounding differences
- Cancelled/adjusted jobs
- Specific business unit exclusions

**Next steps:**
- Check if user excluded any business units
- Verify if any jobs were cancelled/adjusted during the week

## Config.json Updates Needed

The report IDs in [config/config.json](config/config.json) need to be updated:

**Current (outdated):**
```json
"report_ids": {
  "leads": "389357017",              // ✅ Correct (now in marketing category)
  "daily_wbr_cr": "130700652",       // ✅ Correct (now in technician category)
  "daily_wbr_consolidated": "397555674",  // ❓ This is actually "BU Sales - API"
  "foreman_job_cost_this_week": "389438975",  // ✅ Correct
  "collections": "26117979"          // ✅ Correct
}
```

**Recommended updates:**
```json
"report_ids": {
  "leads": "389357017",              // Leads - API (marketing)
  "wbr_bu_sales": "397555674",       // BU Sales - API (technician) - PRIMARY WBR SOURCE
  "wbr_all_technicians": "130700652", // Daily WBR C/R (technician) - BACKUP
  "foreman_job_cost": "389438975",   // Foreman Job Cost (operations)
  "collections": "26117979"          // Collections (accounting)
},
"wbr_report_ids_by_bu": {
  "Phoenix-Sales": 387935289,
  "Tucson-Sales": 387951872,
  "Andy's-Sales": 387936790,
  "Nevada-Sales": 387945741,
  "Commercial-AZ-Sales": 387930556,
  "Guaranteed Painting-Sales": 387945629,
  "West-Sales": 387950018
}
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Create WBR Ingestor (Immediate)

1. Create `wbr_bu_sales.js` ingestor in `v2_ingestor/src/ingestors_reports/`
2. Use BU Sales - API report (397555674)
3. Store in BigQuery table: `st_raw.raw_wbr_bu_sales`
4. Schedule daily sync for previous week

### Phase 2: Create Leads Ingestor

1. Create `leads.js` ingestor in `v2_ingestor/src/ingestors_reports/`
2. Use Leads - API report (389357017)
3. Store in BigQuery table: `st_raw.raw_leads`
4. Investigate and resolve 190 vs 227 discrepancy

### Phase 3: Create Mart Views

1. `st_mart_v2.wbr_weekly` - Weekly WBR metrics by business unit
2. `st_mart_v2.leads_daily` - Daily leads by business unit
3. Update Looker dashboards to use new views

### Phase 4: Validation

1. Compare new implementation to user's baseline for multiple weeks
2. Document any remaining discrepancies
3. Get user sign-off on accuracy

## Key Learnings

1. **WBR reports are in "technician" category**, not sales/operations
