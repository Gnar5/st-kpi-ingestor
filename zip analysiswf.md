## **Chat history**

##### **You said:**

in my bigquery I have all this raw ingested data.... I have a raw\_jobs and a raw\_locations. I am trying to figure out how I could pull the zip code data from teh raw\_locations and pair that with the raw\_jobs and create a map of zip codes we are doing a specific type of job in

###### **ChatGPT said:**

Thought for 29s

Got it — you already have raw\_jobs and raw\_locations. The play is:

1. normalize ZIPs from locations,  
2. join jobs → locations on locationId,  
3. (optionally) filter to the job types you care about,  
4. aggregate by ZIP for your map.

Here’s clean, copy-pasteable BigQuery SQL that does all four and is friendly for Looker Studio/BI Engine.

### **A. Create a reusable view for clean ZIPs (handles ZIP+4, leading zeros)**

*\-- Run once to create a normalization view* CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW st\_stage.locations\_zip\_norm AS WITH loc AS ( SELECT id AS locationId, *\-- grab first 5 digits even if ZIP+4 like '85281-1234'* REGEXP\_EXTRACT(postalCode, r'(\\d{5})') AS zip5\_raw, SAFE\_CAST(longitude AS FLOAT64) AS lon, SAFE\_CAST(latitude AS FLOAT64) AS lat FROM \`your\_project.your\_dataset.raw\_locations\` ) SELECT locationId, *\-- left-pad to preserve leading zeros (e.g., '02110')* LPAD(zip5\_raw, 5, '0') AS zip5, *\-- optional: a point for map tools that like geographies* IF(lon IS NOT NULL AND lat IS NOT NULL, ST\_GEOGPOINT(lon, lat), NULL) AS geo\_point FROM loc WHERE zip5\_raw IS NOT NULL;

### **B. Aggregate jobs by ZIP (filter to a specific job type set)**

Use whichever filter style fits your data best: by jobTypeId allowlist or by jobTypeName via a dim table. Below shows both; keep just one.

*\-- Parameterized version (nice for BI): @start\_date, @end\_date (DATE), @job\_type\_allowlist (ARRAY\<INT64\>)* *\-- If you prefer names, see the alternative filter block below.* WITH jobs\_filtered AS ( SELECT j.id AS jobId, j.locationId, j.jobTypeId, DATE(j.completedOn) AS completed\_date FROM \`your\_project.your\_dataset.raw\_jobs\` j WHERE *\-- date window (edit as needed)* j.completedOn \>= TIMESTAMP(@start\_date) AND j.completedOn \< TIMESTAMP(DATE\_ADD(@end\_date, INTERVAL 1 DAY)) *\-- restrict to the job types you care about* AND j.jobTypeId IN UNNEST(@job\_type\_allowlist) *\-- if you only want completed jobs, uncomment:* *\-- AND j.jobStatus \= 'Completed'* ), joined AS ( SELECT j.jobId, z.zip5 FROM jobs\_filtered j JOIN \`your\_project.your\_dataset.st\_stage.locations\_zip\_norm\` z ON j.locationId \= z.locationId WHERE z.zip5 IS NOT NULL ) SELECT zip5 AS zip\_code, COUNT(\*) AS jobs\_count, COUNT(DISTINCT jobId) AS jobs\_distinct *\-- for safety; should equal COUNT(\*)* FROM joined GROUP BY zip\_code ORDER BY jobs\_count DESC;

Alternative job-type filter (by name):

*\-- If you have a dim table with jobTypeName:* *\-- JOIN your dim and filter by name patterns* WITH jobs\_filtered AS ( SELECT j.id AS jobId, j.locationId, DATE(j.completedOn) AS completed\_date FROM \`your\_project.your\_dataset.raw\_jobs\` j JOIN \`your\_project.your\_dataset.dim\_jobs\` d ON j.jobTypeId \= d.jobTypeId WHERE j.completedOn \>= TIMESTAMP(@start\_date) AND j.completedOn \< TIMESTAMP(DATE\_ADD(@end\_date, INTERVAL 1 DAY)) AND ( d.jobTypeName IN ('ESTIMATE-RES-EXT','ESTIMATE-RES-INT') *\-- exact list* *\-- OR d.jobTypeName LIKE 'ESTIMATE-%' \-- pattern* ) ) *\-- then reuse the same join → group by ZIP as above*

### **C. (Optional) Persist as a view for dashboards**

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW st\_mart.jobs\_by\_zip AS SELECT zip5 AS zip\_code, COUNT(\*) AS jobs\_count FROM ( *\-- paste the SELECT from "joined" above, but without ORDER BY/limits* ) GROUP BY zip\_code;

### **D. Map it (fast \+ simple)**

Looker Studio / Data Studio:

* Connect to the table/view from step B or C.  
* Add a Geo chart.  
* Dimension: zip\_code  
* Type: Postal code  
* Metric: jobs\_count  
* Region: United States  
* That gives you a choropleth by ZIP with your counts.

BigQuery Geo Viz (if you want point maps):

* Use the geo\_point column from st\_stage.locations\_zip\_norm.  
* Aggregate to ZIP first, then pick a representative point (e.g., ANY\_VALUE(geo\_point)), or use centroids if you have ZIP polygons.

### **E. Notes & gotchas**

* Leading zeros: handled via LPAD, critical for northeast ZIPs.  
* ZIP quality: ServiceTitan addresses can be messy; the REGEXP\_EXTRACT keeps the first 5 digits and ignores ZIP+4.  
* One row per job: raw\_jobs is typically 1 row per job, so COUNT(\*) works. I included COUNT(DISTINCT jobId) as a guard.  
* Performance: If raw\_jobs is partitioned by createdOn/completedOn, keep the date predicate on that column to prune scans.  
* Job type set: If you already have a canonical allowlist (you mentioned this elsewhere), drop it into @job\_type\_allowlist.

If you tell me the exact jobTypeIds (or names) you want and your dataset path, I’ll plug them in and return a ready-made view for you.

##### **You said:**

ok we may need to normalize the location data as well as in my current schema it is an array lumped into 1 column of the full address.... should we just have it pull the full address?

###### **ChatGPT said:**

Thought for 13s

Yep—don’t “just pull the full address” for mapping. You want a normalized ZIP per location, even if your address is packed into a single column (string, JSON, or an array). Below are drop-in BigQuery patterns for the common shapes; pick the one that matches your table and create a clean view you can join to raw\_jobs.

# **1\) If the address is a single STRING (full address)**

*\-- Example columns: id, fullAddress (STRING like "123 Main St, Tempe, AZ 85281-1234")* CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW st\_stage.locations\_zip\_norm AS WITH src AS ( SELECT id AS locationId, *\-- pull first 5 digits from ZIP or ZIP+4* LPAD(REGEXP\_EXTRACT(fullAddress, r'(\\d{5})'), 5, '0') AS zip5 FROM \`your\_project.your\_dataset.raw\_locations\` ) SELECT locationId, zip5 FROM src WHERE zip5 IS NOT NULL;

# **2\) If the address is JSON in a STRING column**

*\-- Example columns: id, address\_json (STRING with keys like postalCode or zip)* CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW st\_stage.locations\_zip\_norm AS WITH src AS ( SELECT id AS locationId, *\-- Try dedicated key first (postalCode/zip), then fallback to regex over entire JSON text* LPAD( COALESCE( REGEXP\_EXTRACT(JSON\_VALUE(address\_json, '$.postalCode'), r'(\\d{5})'), REGEXP\_EXTRACT(JSON\_VALUE(address\_json, '$.zip'), r'(\\d{5})'), REGEXP\_EXTRACT(address\_json, r'(\\d{5})') *\-- last resort* ), 5, '0' ) AS zip5 FROM \`your\_project.your\_dataset.raw\_locations\` ) SELECT locationId, zip5 FROM src WHERE zip5 IS NOT NULL;

# **3\) If the address is an ARRAY (strings or structs)**

### **3a) ARRAY\<STRING\> (e.g.,** \["123 Main", "Tempe AZ 85281"\]**)**

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW st\_stage.locations\_zip\_norm AS WITH src AS ( SELECT id AS locationId, LPAD(REGEXP\_EXTRACT(ARRAY\_TO\_STRING(address\_lines, ' '), r'(\\d{5})'), 5, '0') AS zip5 FROM \`your\_project.your\_dataset.raw\_locations\` ) SELECT locationId, zip5 FROM src WHERE zip5 IS NOT NULL;

### **3b) ARRAY\<STRUCT\> with fields (prefer one “primary”)**

*\-- Example: addresses ARRAY\<STRUCT\<type STRING, line1 STRING, city STRING, state STRING, postalCode STRING, ...\>\>* CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW st\_stage.locations\_zip\_norm AS WITH exploded AS ( SELECT id AS locationId, a.type, LPAD(REGEXP\_EXTRACT(a.postalCode, r'(\\d{5})'), 5, '0') AS zip5\_from\_field, LPAD(REGEXP\_EXTRACT( CONCAT(a.line1,' ',a.city,' ',a.state,' ',a.postalCode), r'(\\d{5})' ), 5, '0') AS zip5\_from\_concat FROM \`your\_project.your\_dataset.raw\_locations\`, UNNEST(addresses) AS a ), ranked AS ( SELECT locationId, COALESCE(zip5\_from\_field, zip5\_from\_concat) AS zip5, ROW\_NUMBER() OVER ( PARTITION BY locationId ORDER BY IFNULL(type \= 'Primary', FALSE) DESC, *\-- prefer primary if flagged* zip5\_from\_field IS NULL, *\-- prefer explicit postalCode* locationId ) AS rn FROM exploded ) SELECT locationId, zip5 FROM ranked WHERE rn \= 1 AND zip5 IS NOT NULL;  
---

# **Join to jobs and aggregate for your ZIP map**

*\-- Parameters you can pass from BI tools:* *\-- @start\_date (DATE), @end\_date (DATE)* *\-- @job\_type\_allowlist (ARRAY\<INT64\>) \-- or switch to a name-based filter if you have a dim table* WITH jobs\_filtered AS ( SELECT j.id AS jobId, j.locationId FROM \`your\_project.your\_dataset.raw\_jobs\` j WHERE j.completedOn \>= TIMESTAMP(@start\_date) AND j.completedOn \< TIMESTAMP(DATE\_ADD(@end\_date, INTERVAL 1 DAY)) AND j.jobTypeId IN UNNEST(@job\_type\_allowlist) *\-- or replace with your logic* ), joined AS ( SELECT z.zip5 AS zip\_code, j.jobId FROM jobs\_filtered j JOIN \`your\_project.your\_dataset.st\_stage.locations\_zip\_norm\` z ON j.locationId \= z.locationId ) SELECT zip\_code, COUNT(\*) AS jobs\_count, COUNT(DISTINCT jobId) AS jobs\_distinct FROM joined GROUP BY zip\_code ORDER BY jobs\_count DESC;  
---

# **Why not “just store the full address”?**

* Map charts want a stable geographic key (ZIP, FIPS, etc.). Freeform addresses vary in punctuation, casing, abbreviations, and ZIP+4—hard to group reliably.  
* Normalizing once in a view keeps all downstream charts stable (and fast), while letting your raw stay raw.

---

If you tell me which of the three shapes your raw\_locations actually is (string, JSON, or array/struct) and your dataset path, I’ll return the exact view definition with your identifiers plugged in.

sorry to confirm I've attached the 3 schemas from Bigquery to confirm we are heading in the right path

###### **ChatGPT said:**

Thought for 32s

Perfect—your screenshots confirm:

* raw\_jobs: has locationId  
* raw\_locations: has address JSON  
* (There’s also a customer table with an address JSON, but we can join via locationId → raw\_locations)

Here’s the exact pattern you need: normalize ZIP from that JSON once, then join to jobs and aggregate.

# **1\) Normalize ZIPs from** raw\_locations.address **(JSON)**

*\-- Adjust project/dataset names if yours differ (e.g., \`kpi-auto-471020.st\_raw\`)* CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW \`your\_project.st\_stage.locations\_zip\_norm\` AS WITH src AS ( SELECT id AS locationId, *\-- Try dedicated JSON keys first, then fall back to a regex over the full JSON* LPAD( COALESCE( REGEXP\_EXTRACT(JSON\_VALUE(address, '$.postalCode'), r'(\\d{5})'), REGEXP\_EXTRACT(JSON\_VALUE(address, '$.zip'), r'(\\d{5})'), REGEXP\_EXTRACT(TO\_JSON\_STRING(address), r'(\\d{5})') *\-- last resort* ), 5, '0' ) AS zip5, *\-- Optional lat/lon if present (many ServiceTitan payloads have these keys)* SAFE\_CAST(JSON\_VALUE(address, '$.longitude') AS FLOAT64) AS lon, SAFE\_CAST(JSON\_VALUE(address, '$.latitude') AS FLOAT64) AS lat FROM \`your\_project.st\_raw.raw\_locations\` ) SELECT locationId, zip5, IF(lon IS NOT NULL AND lat IS NOT NULL, ST\_GEOGPOINT(lon, lat), NULL) AS geo\_point FROM src WHERE zip5 IS NOT NULL;

# **2\) Jobs × ZIP for a specific job type set (and date window)**

Use your allowlist of jobTypeIds (or swap to name-based filtering if you prefer). Dates are optional but recommended for faster scans.

DECLARE start\_date DATE DEFAULT DATE\_SUB(CURRENT\_DATE(), INTERVAL 365 DAY); DECLARE end\_date DATE DEFAULT CURRENT\_DATE(); DECLARE job\_type\_allowlist ARRAY\<INT64\> DEFAULT \[*/\* e.g. 705812, 727572, ... \*/*\]; WITH jobs\_filtered AS ( SELECT j.id AS jobId, j.locationId FROM \`your\_project.st\_raw.raw\_jobs\` j WHERE (j.completedOn IS NULL OR (j.completedOn \>= TIMESTAMP(start\_date) AND j.completedOn \< TIMESTAMP(DATE\_ADD(end\_date, INTERVAL 1 DAY)))) AND (ARRAY\_LENGTH(job\_type\_allowlist) \= 0 OR j.jobTypeId IN UNNEST(job\_type\_allowlist)) *\-- Uncomment if you only want completed:* *\-- AND j.jobStatus \= 'Completed'* ), joined AS ( SELECT z.zip5 AS zip\_code, j.jobId FROM jobs\_filtered j JOIN \`your\_project.st\_stage.locations\_zip\_norm\` z ON j.locationId \= z.locationId ) SELECT zip\_code, COUNT(\*) AS jobs\_count, COUNT(DISTINCT jobId) AS jobs\_distinct FROM joined GROUP BY zip\_code ORDER BY jobs\_count DESC;

# **3\) (Optional) Persist for dashboards**

CREATE OR REPLACE MATERIALIZED VIEW \`your\_project.st\_mart.jobs\_by\_zip\` AS SELECT z.zip5 AS zip\_code, COUNT(\*) AS jobs\_count FROM \`your\_project.st\_raw.raw\_jobs\` j JOIN \`your\_project.st\_stage.locations\_zip\_norm\` z ON j.locationId \= z.locationId GROUP BY zip\_code;

Use report-level filters (date range, job type) in Looker Studio or create separate parameterized views if you need those baked in.

# **4\) Map it fast**

* In Looker Studio: Dimension \= zip\_code (Postal code), Metric \= jobs\_count, Region \= United States → Geo chart or filled map.  
* If you want points, use geo\_point (centroids from locations) with ANY\_VALUE(geo\_point) per ZIP, or keep it at the raw “one point per job” level.

# **Notes**

* Leading zeros handled via LPAD.  
* ZIP+4 handled by REGEXP\_EXTRACT.  
* If your address JSON uses different keys, tell me the exact blob of one row and I’ll tune the JSON paths.  
* For performance, keep predicates on partitioned columns (e.g., completedOn) in queries/views you run frequently.

If you drop me the actual jobTypeId allowlist you care about, I’ll plug it directly into a ready-to-run view for your mart.

##### **You said:**

whoops sorry I think something is messed up :  
Not found: Table kpi-auto-471020:st\_raw.raw\_locations was not found in location US

###### **ChatGPT said:**

Thought for 25s

No worries — that error usually means one of two things:

1. the table path is slightly off (project/dataset/table name), or  
2. you’re querying in the wrong location (e.g., your dataset is in us-central1 but the query job is set to US, or vice-versa).

Here’s a quick, copy-paste checklist to fix it fast.

# **1\) Find the *actual* dataset \+ location**

Run these to locate raw\_jobs / raw\_locations:

*\-- Search US multi-region* SELECT table\_catalog AS project\_id, table\_schema AS dataset, table\_name, location FROM \`region-us\`.INFORMATION\_SCHEMA.TABLES WHERE table\_name IN ('raw\_jobs','raw\_locations'); *\-- Search us-central1 (common for ST pipelines)* SELECT table\_catalog AS project\_id, table\_schema AS dataset, table\_name, location FROM \`region-us-central1\`.INFORMATION\_SCHEMA.TABLES WHERE table\_name IN ('raw\_jobs','raw\_locations');

Note the dataset (e.g., st\_raw) and location (e.g., US or us-central1).

# **2\) Match your query job’s processing location**

* BigQuery UI: Query settings → Processing location → choose the dataset’s location.  
* bq CLI: add \--location=us-central1 (or US) to your bq commands.

If locations don’t match, you’ll get exactly the “not found in location US” error even when the table exists.

# **3\) Create the ZIP normalization view using the correct path**

Replace the placeholders below with what you found in step 1\.

*\-- Example: project=kpi-auto-471020, dataset=st\_raw, stage dataset=st\_stage, location=us-central1 or US* CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW \`kpi-auto\-471020.st\_stage.locations\_zip\_norm\` AS WITH src AS ( SELECT id AS locationId, LPAD( COALESCE( REGEXP\_EXTRACT(JSON\_VALUE(address, '$.postalCode'), r'(\\d{5})'), REGEXP\_EXTRACT(JSON\_VALUE(address, '$.zip'), r'(\\d{5})'), REGEXP\_EXTRACT(TO\_JSON\_STRING(address), r'(\\d{5})') *\-- last resort* ), 5, '0' ) AS zip5, SAFE\_CAST(JSON\_VALUE(address, '$.longitude') AS FLOAT64) AS lon, SAFE\_CAST(JSON\_VALUE(address, '$.latitude') AS FLOAT64) AS lat FROM \`kpi-auto\-471020.st\_raw.raw\_locations\` ) SELECT locationId, zip5, IF(lon IS NOT NULL AND lat IS NOT NULL, ST\_GEOGPOINT(lon, lat), NULL) AS geo\_point FROM src WHERE zip5 IS NOT NULL;

# **4\) Join jobs → ZIP (same dataset \+ location)**

*\-- Adjust project/dataset and make sure Query Settings use the same location.* WITH jobs\_filtered AS ( SELECT j.id AS jobId, j.locationId FROM \`kpi-auto\-471020.st\_raw.raw\_jobs\` j *\-- add your date/jobType filters here if needed* ), joined AS ( SELECT z.zip5 AS zip\_code, j.jobId FROM jobs\_filtered j JOIN \`kpi-auto\-471020.st\_stage.locations\_zip\_norm\` z ON j.locationId \= z.locationId ) SELECT zip\_code, COUNT(\*) AS jobs\_count, COUNT(DISTINCT jobId) AS jobs\_distinct FROM joined GROUP BY zip\_code ORDER BY jobs\_count DESC;

If you paste the results from step 1 (project/dataset/location you discover), I’ll plug them into the statements exactly so you can run them without any edits.

Gotcha — that’s an IAM/permissions issue, not SQL. Here’s the fastest way to unblock yourself in BigQuery.

# **Quick fix checklist (UI)**

1. Confirm you’re in the right project  
* In the BigQuery Explorer, the bold project at the top should be the one you expect (e.g., kpi-auto-471020).  
* If not visible: \+ ADD DATA → Pin a project → Enter project ID.  
2. You need these minimum roles  
* At the *project* level (your user or group):  
  * BigQuery Job User (roles/bigquery.jobUser) – lets you run queries.  
  * *(Optional but common)* BigQuery User (roles/bigquery.user) – browse metadata.  
* At the *dataset* level:  
  * On st\_raw: BigQuery Data Viewer (roles/bigquery.dataViewer) – read raw\_jobs, raw\_locations.  
  * On st\_stage: BigQuery Data Editor (roles/bigquery.dataEditor) – create the locations\_zip\_norm view.  
    *(If you want full control there, use Data Owner.)*

How to grant: IAM & Admin → IAM → Grant access (for project-level roles).  
For dataset roles: in BigQuery Explorer, click the ⋮ next to the dataset → Share → add your principal with the dataset role.

3. Common error → meaning  
* “\*\*Permission denied: Project X: User does not have bigquery

##### **You said:**

Maybe we need to just start from the beginning and not mess with the IAM stuff

###### **ChatGPT said:**

Thought for 24s

Totally fine—let’s avoid creating anything (no views, no IAM tweaks) and just run a single read-only query that:

* parses ZIP from your address JSON in raw\_locations  
* joins to raw\_jobs on locationId  
* (optionally) filters by date and jobTypeId  
* aggregates by ZIP for your map

Replace your\_project.your\_dataset with your actual paths, set the Processing location in Query settings to match the dataset, and run:

*\-- ONE-SHOT READ-ONLY QUERY (no CREATEs)* *\-- Optional knobs: uncomment & edit* *\-- DECLARE start\_date DATE DEFAULT DATE\_SUB(CURRENT\_DATE(), INTERVAL 365 DAY);* *\-- DECLARE end\_date DATE DEFAULT CURRENT\_DATE();* *\-- DECLARE job\_type\_allowlist ARRAY\<INT64\> DEFAULT \[/\* e.g. 705812, 727572 \*/\];* WITH locations\_zip\_norm AS ( SELECT id AS locationId, *\-- Extract first 5 digits from address JSON (handles ZIP+4). Try common keys, then fallback to regex.* LPAD( COALESCE( REGEXP\_EXTRACT(JSON\_VALUE(address, '$.postalCode'), r'(\\d{5})'), REGEXP\_EXTRACT(JSON\_VALUE(address, '$.zip'), r'(\\d{5})'), REGEXP\_EXTRACT(TO\_JSON\_STRING(address), r'(\\d{5})') *\-- last resort* ), 5, '0' ) AS zip5 FROM \`your\_project.your\_dataset.raw\_locations\` WHERE address IS NOT NULL ), jobs\_filtered AS ( SELECT j.id AS jobId, j.locationId, j.jobTypeId, j.completedOn FROM \`your\_project.your\_dataset.raw\_jobs\` j WHERE TRUE *\-- Optional date window (uncomment if you want it)* *\-- AND j.completedOn \>= TIMESTAMP(start\_date)* *\-- AND j.completedOn \< TIMESTAMP(DATE\_ADD(end\_date, INTERVAL 1 DAY))* *\-- Optional job type allowlist (uncomment and set the array above)* *\-- AND j.jobTypeId IN UNNEST(job\_type\_allowlist)* *\-- Optional status filter* *\-- AND j.jobStatus \= 'Completed'* ), joined AS ( SELECT z.zip5 AS zip\_code, j.jobId FROM jobs\_filtered j JOIN locations\_zip\_norm z ON j.locationId \= z.locationId WHERE z.zip5 IS NOT NULL ) SELECT zip\_code, COUNT(\*) AS jobs\_count, COUNT(DISTINCT jobId) AS jobs\_distinct FROM joined GROUP BY zip\_code ORDER BY jobs\_count DESC;

### **Use it for a map**

In Looker Studio: connect this query as a data source (or paste results to a table), set Dimension \= zip\_code (Postal code), Metric \= jobs\_count, Region \= United States → Geo chart.

### **If it errors on location**

In the BigQuery editor: click Query settings → Processing location and choose the dataset’s location (e.g., US or us-central1). That fixes the “not found in location” type errors without touching IAM.

Want me to plug in your exact project/dataset and a job type list (e.g., your estimate/sales types) so it’s 100% paste-and-run?

##### **You said:**

my project id is kpi-auto-471020

###### **ChatGPT said:**

Perfect — since your project ID is confirmed as kpi-auto-471020, here’s a fully self-contained query that will run *read-only* (no need to create any views or touch IAM).

Just paste this into BigQuery, open Query settings → Processing location, and select US or us-central1 (whichever your dataset shows). Then replace your\_dataset with the dataset that actually contains your raw\_jobs and raw\_locations tables — it’s probably st\_raw.  
---

### **✅ One-Shot ZIP Mapping Query**

*\-- Read-only ZIP code mapping query* *\-- Replace st\_raw with your actual dataset name* WITH locations\_zip\_norm AS ( SELECT id AS locationId, *\-- Extract 5-digit ZIP from the address JSON (handles ZIP+4 or missing fields)* LPAD( COALESCE( REGEXP\_EXTRACT(JSON\_VALUE(address, '$.postalCode'), r'(\\d{5})'), REGEXP\_EXTRACT(JSON\_VALUE(address, '$.zip'), r'(\\d{5})'), REGEXP\_EXTRACT(TO\_JSON\_STRING(address), r'(\\d{5})') ), 5, '0' ) AS zip5 FROM \`kpi-auto\-471020.st\_raw.raw\_locations\` WHERE address IS NOT NULL ), jobs\_filtered AS ( SELECT j.id AS jobId, j.locationId, j.jobTypeId, j.completedOn, j.jobStatus FROM \`kpi-auto\-471020.st\_raw.raw\_jobs\` j WHERE TRUE *\-- Uncomment these if you want to limit the data:* *\-- AND j.jobStatus \= 'Completed'* *\-- AND j.completedOn \>= TIMESTAMP\_SUB(CURRENT\_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 1 YEAR)* ), joined AS ( SELECT z.zip5 AS zip\_code, j.jobId FROM jobs\_filtered j JOIN locations\_zip\_norm z ON j.locationId \= z.locationId WHERE z.zip5 IS NOT NULL ) SELECT zip\_code, COUNT(\*) AS jobs\_count FROM joined GROUP BY zip\_code ORDER BY jobs\_count DESC;  
---

### **💡 How to Verify Dataset Names**

If you’re unsure of your dataset name, run this helper query first:

SELECT table\_schema AS dataset\_name, table\_name FROM \`kpi-auto\-471020\`.INFORMATION\_SCHEMA.TABLES WHERE table\_name IN ('raw\_jobs', 'raw\_locations');

It’ll show something like:

| dataset\_name | table\_name |
| ----- | ----- |
| st\_raw | raw\_jobs |
| st\_raw | raw\_locations |

Then plug that dataset name into the main query.  
---

### **🗺️ Mapping in Looker Studio**

Once you have results:

* Connect this query’s results or the table to Looker Studio.  
* Use Dimension: zip\_code (type \= *Postal code*)  
* Use Metric: jobs\_count  
* Choose Map chart → Filled map (by postal code)

That will give you a ZIP heat map of where you’re performing work.  
---

Would you like me to add filters for *specific jobTypeIds* (like just residential estimates or just production jobs)? I can modify the query so you can toggle those easily.

###### **ChatGPT said:**

Thought for 10s

Got it — switching to st\_raw\_v2. Here’s a read-only, paste-and-run query that pulls ZIPs from raw\_locations.address (JSON), joins to raw\_jobs, and aggregates by ZIP for mapping.

### **One-shot ZIP map (st\_raw\_v2)**

*\-- Set Query settings → Processing location to match the dataset (US or us-central1)* WITH locations\_zip\_norm AS ( SELECT id AS locationId, *\-- Extract 5-digit ZIP from JSON (works with ZIP+4 too)* LPAD( COALESCE( REGEXP\_EXTRACT(JSON\_VALUE(address, '$.postalCode'), r'(\\d{5})'), REGEXP\_EXTRACT(JSON\_VALUE(address, '$.zip'), r'(\\d{5})'), REGEXP\_EXTRACT(TO\_JSON\_STRING(address), r'(\\d{5})') *\-- fallback* ), 5, '0' ) AS zip5 FROM \`kpi-auto\-471020.st\_raw\_v2.raw\_locations\` WHERE address IS NOT NULL ), jobs\_filtered AS ( SELECT j.id AS jobId, j.locationId, j.jobTypeId, j.completedOn, j.jobStatus FROM \`kpi-auto\-471020.st\_raw\_v2.raw\_jobs\` j WHERE TRUE *\-- Optional filters:* *\-- AND j.jobStatus \= 'Completed'* *\-- AND j.completedOn \>= TIMESTAMP\_SUB(CURRENT\_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 1 YEAR)* *\-- AND j.jobTypeId IN (705812, 727572\) \-- example allowlist* ), joined AS ( SELECT z.zip5 AS zip\_code, j.jobId FROM jobs\_filtered j JOIN locations\_zip\_norm z ON j.locationId \= z.locationId WHERE z.zip5 IS NOT NULL ) SELECT zip\_code, COUNT(\*) AS jobs\_count, COUNT(DISTINCT jobId) AS jobs\_distinct FROM joined GROUP BY zip\_code ORDER BY jobs\_count DESC;

### **If you still see a “location US” error**

Run this to confirm the dataset’s region, then set Query settings → Processing location to that exact value:

*\-- Find the dataset location for st\_raw\_v2* SELECT schema\_name AS dataset, location FROM \`region-us\`.INFORMATION\_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA WHERE schema\_name \= 'st\_raw\_v2' UNION ALL SELECT schema\_name, location FROM \`region-us-central1\`.INFORMATION\_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA WHERE schema\_name \= 'st\_raw\_v2';

### **Mapping tip (Looker Studio)**

Use Dimension \= zip\_code (postal code), Metric \= jobs\_count, Region \= United States → Geo chart / filled map.

Want me to add a parameterized version for specific jobTypeIds or a date range you can toggle?

##### **You said:**

ok no location error.... how do I see a yoy comparison for the zips now?

###### **ChatGPT said:**

Excellent — since your join now works and returns ZIP totals, we can easily layer in year-over-year (YoY) logic with one more grouping column.

Below is the full BigQuery query (using your confirmed project/dataset: kpi-auto-471020.st\_raw\_v2) that:

* extracts ZIPs from raw\_locations  
* joins to raw\_jobs  
* groups by ZIP \+ year  
* then produces both *per-year totals* and *YoY delta / percent change*

### **🧮 Year-Over-Year by ZIP**

*\-- ✅ Paste this in BigQuery; it reads only, no view creation* *\-- Make sure Query Settings → Processing location matches your dataset (US or us-central1)* WITH locations\_zip\_norm AS ( SELECT id AS locationId, LPAD( COALESCE( REGEXP\_EXTRACT(JSON\_VALUE(address, '$.postalCode'), r'(\\d{5})'), REGEXP\_EXTRACT(JSON\_VALUE(address, '$.zip'), r'(\\d{5})'), REGEXP\_EXTRACT(TO\_JSON\_STRING(address), r'(\\d{5})') ), 5, '0' ) AS zip5 FROM \`kpi-auto\-471020.st\_raw\_v2.raw\_locations\` WHERE address IS NOT NULL ), jobs\_base AS ( SELECT j.id AS jobId, j.locationId, EXTRACT(YEAR FROM j.completedOn) AS job\_year, j.completedOn, j.jobStatus FROM \`kpi-auto\-471020.st\_raw\_v2.raw\_jobs\` j WHERE j.completedOn IS NOT NULL *\-- Optional: uncomment to narrow scope* *\-- AND j.jobStatus \= 'Completed'* ), joined AS ( SELECT z.zip5 AS zip\_code, b.job\_year, b.jobId FROM jobs\_base b JOIN locations\_zip\_norm z ON b.locationId \= z.locationId WHERE z.zip5 IS NOT NULL ), yearly AS ( SELECT zip\_code, job\_year, COUNT(DISTINCT jobId) AS jobs\_count FROM joined GROUP BY zip\_code, job\_year ), yoy AS ( SELECT zip\_code, job\_year, jobs\_count, LAG(jobs\_count) OVER (PARTITION BY zip\_code ORDER BY job\_year) AS prev\_year\_jobs, SAFE\_DIVIDE(jobs\_count \- LAG(jobs\_count) OVER (PARTITION BY zip\_code ORDER BY job\_year), LAG(jobs\_count) OVER (PARTITION BY zip\_code ORDER BY job\_year)) AS yoy\_change\_ratio FROM yearly ) SELECT zip\_code, job\_year, jobs\_count, prev\_year\_jobs, yoy\_change\_ratio, ROUND(yoy\_change\_ratio \* 100, 1) AS yoy\_change\_percent FROM yoy ORDER BY zip\_code, job\_year;  
---

### **📊 How to visualize**

In Looker Studio or any BI tool:

* Dimension 1: zip\_code  
* Dimension 2: job\_year  
* Metric: jobs\_count  
  (or yoy\_change\_percent if you want to color by growth)  
* Use a Pivot table or Bar chart by ZIP with Year columns  
  or a Map filtered to a given year and color-coded by YoY %.

---

### **🧠 Notes**

* Works even if some ZIPs appear in only one year — prev\_year\_jobs will be NULL.  
* Handles missing years automatically (no hard-coded years).  
* Add AND jobStatus \= 'Completed' if you only want finished work.  
* To restrict to specific job types, add:  
* AND j.jobTypeId IN (705812, 727572)  
   inside the jobs\_base CTE.

---

Would you like me to pivot this so you see side-by-side columns like 2023\_jobs, 2024\_jobs, and yoy\_change\_% per ZIP (instead of one row per year)? That’s often cleaner for dashboards.

##### **You said:**

hmm when I setup the chart and do a comparison year I am not seeing that column show up for some reason

###### **ChatGPT said:**

Thought for 17s

You’re not seeing “Comparison date range” because a map by ZIP doesn’t have a Date dimension. In Looker Studio, the comparison control only appears when the chart includes a Date field (time series, scorecard, tables with a Date, etc.). A postal-code map uses ZIP as the dimension, so the comparison UI won’t show up.

Two solid ways to get YoY on a ZIP map:

# **Option A — Build YoY in SQL (best for maps)**

Return both current year and prior year counts (plus YoY %) as separate metrics per ZIP. Then the map can color by jobs\_curr\_year, and show jobs\_prev\_year and yoy\_change\_% in the tooltip.

*\-- Processing location: match your dataset (US or us-central1)* *\-- Project/Datasets per your note: kpi-auto-471020.st\_raw\_v2* DECLARE curr\_year INT64 DEFAULT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM CURRENT\_DATE()); DECLARE prev\_year INT64 DEFAULT curr\_year \- 1; WITH locations\_zip\_norm AS ( SELECT id AS locationId, LPAD( COALESCE( REGEXP\_EXTRACT(JSON\_VALUE(address, '$.postalCode'), r'(\\d{5})'), REGEXP\_EXTRACT(JSON\_VALUE(address, '$.zip'), r'(\\d{5})'), REGEXP\_EXTRACT(TO\_JSON\_STRING(address), r'(\\d{5})') ), 5, '0' ) AS zip5 FROM \`kpi-auto\-471020.st\_raw\_v2.raw\_locations\` WHERE address IS NOT NULL ), jobs\_base AS ( SELECT j.id AS jobId, j.locationId, EXTRACT(YEAR FROM j.completedOn) AS job\_year FROM \`kpi-auto\-471020.st\_raw\_v2.raw\_jobs\` j WHERE j.completedOn IS NOT NULL *\-- AND j.jobStatus \= 'Completed' \-- optional* *\-- AND j.jobTypeId IN (705812, 727572\) \-- optional allowlist* ), joined AS ( SELECT z.zip5 AS zip\_code, b.job\_year, b.jobId FROM jobs\_base b JOIN locations\_zip\_norm z ON b.locationId \= z.locationId WHERE z.zip5 IS NOT NULL ), agg AS ( SELECT zip\_code, COUNT(DISTINCT IF(job\_year \= curr\_year, jobId, NULL)) AS jobs\_curr\_year, COUNT(DISTINCT IF(job\_year \= prev\_year, jobId, NULL)) AS jobs\_prev\_year FROM joined GROUP BY zip\_code ) SELECT zip\_code, jobs\_curr\_year, jobs\_prev\_year, SAFE\_DIVIDE(jobs\_curr\_year \- jobs\_prev\_year, NULLIF(jobs\_prev\_year,0)) AS yoy\_change\_ratio, ROUND(SAFE\_MULTIPLY(SAFE\_DIVIDE(jobs\_curr\_year \- jobs\_prev\_year, NULLIF(jobs\_prev\_year,0)),100), 1) AS yoy\_change\_percent FROM agg ORDER BY jobs\_curr\_year DESC;

In Looker Studio:

* Chart: Geo chart (filled) or Geo map  
* Dimension: zip\_code (Postal code)  
* Metric: jobs\_curr\_year  
* Style/Tooltip: add jobs\_prev\_year and yoy\_change\_percent so users see YoY on hover.  
* If you want to switch the comparison years, change the DECLARE curr\_year logic (or parameterize it with a report control / query parameter later).

# **Option B — Use comparison on a chart that has a Date dimension**

If you specifically want the built-in “Comparison date range”:

* Use a chart with a Date dimension (e.g., time series, bar chart by month, or a pivot table with Date).  
* Ensure your field is a true Date (cast completedOn to DATE(completedOn) in the data source or SQL).  
* Then enable Date range and Comparison date range in the chart panel.

Example (table with Date so comparison works):

WITH base AS ( SELECT DATE(j.completedOn) AS completed\_date, EXTRACT(YEAR FROM j.completedOn) AS job\_year, z.zip5 AS zip\_code, j.id AS jobId FROM \`kpi-auto\-471020.st\_raw\_v2.raw\_jobs\` j JOIN ( SELECT id AS locationId, LPAD(COALESCE( REGEXP\_EXTRACT(JSON\_VALUE(address, '$.postalCode'), r'(\\d{5})'), REGEXP\_EXTRACT(JSON\_VALUE(address, '$.zip'), r'(\\d{5})'), REGEXP\_EXTRACT(TO\_JSON\_STRING(address), r'(\\d{5})') ),5,'0') AS zip5 FROM \`kpi-auto\-471020.st\_raw\_v2.raw\_locations\` WHERE address IS NOT NULL ) z ON j.locationId \= z.locationId WHERE j.completedOn IS NOT NULL ) SELECT completed\_date, zip\_code, COUNT(DISTINCT jobId) AS jobs\_count FROM base GROUP BY completed\_date, zip\_code

Then in Looker Studio:

* Set Date dimension \= completed\_date  
* Dimension (secondary) \= zip\_code (or filter to one/few ZIPs)  
* Enable Comparison date range in the chart.

---

### **Quick pick**

* Want YoY on the map itself → use Option A (two metrics \+ YoY in SQL; show YoY in tooltip).  
* Want the built-in comparison UI → use Option B (charts with a Date dimension).

If you tell me the exact years (e.g., 2024 vs 2025\) or want it parameterized, I’ll tweak Option A to accept a year control so you can switch years without editing SQL.

##### **You said:**

ok the geo map isn't doing much with just the zip codes as the postal codes..... how do we fix that?

###### **ChatGPT said:**

Good question — what’s happening is that ZIP/postal codes alone don’t have built-in geography (lat/lon) in BigQuery or Looker Studio, so the map can’t actually *draw* them.  
You have two good ways to fix it depending on how precise you want your visuals:  
---

## **🗺️ Option A — Join ZIPs to latitude/longitude centroids (fast and simple)**

You can download or query a public ZIP → lat/lon dataset such as:

SELECT zip\_code, latitude, longitude FROM \`bigquery-public-data.census\_bureau\_zipcodes.zip\_codes\`;

*(If that public table isn’t visible in your project, you can import a CSV from the Census “ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTA)” dataset — it’s open data.)*

Then extend your current aggregation:

WITH jobs\_by\_zip AS ( SELECT z.zip5 AS zip\_code, COUNT(\*) AS jobs\_count FROM \`kpi-auto\-471020.st\_raw\_v2.raw\_jobs\` j JOIN ( SELECT id AS locationId, LPAD(REGEXP\_EXTRACT(TO\_JSON\_STRING(address), r'(\\d{5})'),5,'0') AS zip5 FROM \`kpi-auto\-471020.st\_raw\_v2.raw\_locations\` ) z ON j.locationId \= z.locationId WHERE z.zip5 IS NOT NULL GROUP BY zip\_code ), zip\_points AS ( SELECT CAST(zip\_code AS STRING) AS zip\_code, latitude, longitude FROM \`bigquery-public-data.census\_bureau\_zipcodes.zip\_codes\` ) SELECT j.zip\_code, j.jobs\_count, ST\_GEOGPOINT(z.longitude, z.latitude) AS geo\_point FROM jobs\_by\_zip j JOIN zip\_points z ON j.zip\_code \= z.zip\_code;

Then in Looker Studio:

* Dimension → geo\_point (type \= Geo field)  
* Metric → jobs\_count  
* Chart → “Geo map (points)” or “Geo bubble map”

Now you’ll see actual pins / heat bubbles per ZIP.  
---

## **🌎 Option B — Use official ZIP polygon shapes (for true choropleth)**

If you want the map shaded by area instead of points:

1. Import ZIP polygon geometries (ZCTA boundaries).  
   Example public table:  
2. SELECT zip\_code, geom FROM \`bigquery-public-data.geo\_us\_boundaries.zipcode\_area\`;  
3. Join your jobs\_by\_zip output to that table on ZIP code.  
4. In Looker Studio, pick Dimension \= geom (Geography), Metric \= jobs\_count, and choose a filled map.

That paints each ZIP region based on job volume.  
---

## **✅ Recommendation**

For business KPI dashboards, Option A (centroids) is faster, cheaper, and accurate enough visually.  
Only use polygons if you need precise area shading or analytics by region boundaries.  
---

Would you like me to give you a ready-to-run query that merges your st\_raw\_v2 data with that public ZIP centroid table and produces a Looker-ready dataset (including YoY columns)?

###### **ChatGPT said:**

Yes — that dataset is perfect ✅

bigquery-public-data.utility\_us.zipcode\_area already contains:

* the ZIP code,  
* latitude/longitude,  
* and a polygon geometry (zipcode\_geom) field that Looker Studio can draw directly on a map.

Let’s wire it into your pipeline.  
---

### **💡 New Query — Merge your jobs data with** zipcode\_area

This version joins your job counts to that public ZIP polygon dataset so you can use filled geographic areas in Looker Studio.

*\-- Adjust Query settings → Processing location \= US* *\-- Project: kpi-auto-471020 | Dataset: st\_raw\_v2* WITH locations\_zip\_norm AS ( SELECT id AS locationId, LPAD( COALESCE( REGEXP\_EXTRACT(JSON\_VALUE(address, '$.postalCode'), r'(\\d{5})'), REGEXP\_EXTRACT(JSON\_VALUE(address, '$.zip'), r'(\\d{5})'), REGEXP\_EXTRACT(TO\_JSON\_STRING(address), r'(\\d{5})') ), 5, '0' ) AS zip5 FROM \`kpi-auto\-471020.st\_raw\_v2.raw\_locations\` WHERE address IS NOT NULL ), jobs\_by\_zip AS ( SELECT z.zip5 AS zipcode, COUNT(DISTINCT j.id) AS jobs\_count FROM \`kpi-auto\-471020.st\_raw\_v2.raw\_jobs\` j JOIN locations\_zip\_norm z ON j.locationId \= z.locationId WHERE z.zip5 IS NOT NULL AND j.completedOn IS NOT NULL *\-- Optional filters* *\-- AND j.jobStatus \= 'Completed'* *\-- AND j.jobTypeId IN (705812, 727572\)* GROUP BY z.zip5 ) SELECT j.zipcode, j.jobs\_count, u.latitude, u.longitude, ST\_GEOGFROMTEXT(u.zipcode\_geom) AS zipcode\_geom, u.state\_name, u.city, u.county FROM jobs\_by\_zip j JOIN \`bigquery-public-data.utility\_us.zipcode\_area\` u ON j.zipcode \= u.zipcode;  
---

### **🗺️ In Looker Studio**

When you connect this query as a data source:

* Dimension: zipcode\_geom → change type to Geography  
* Metric: jobs\_count  
* Chart Type: *Geo chart → Filled map (by postal code)*  
  or *Geo chart (bubble)* if you prefer point centroids.

That will color each ZIP area by how many jobs you’ve done there.  
---

### **✨ Optional: Add Year/YoY Columns**

To show growth by ZIP, you can merge this with the YoY logic we wrote earlier — essentially group by zipcode, job\_year first, then join to this ZIP polygon dataset instead of the centroid dataset.

Would you like me to build that combined “YoY \+ geometry” version next (so you can map each ZIP’s YoY % as color)?

##### **You said:**

I don't think we have a date dim in this new one and the geo map is still blank....

###### **ChatGPT said:**

Exactly — that dataset (bigquery-public-data.utility\_us.zipcode\_area) gives us both latitude/longitude and a polygon, but the polygon field (zipcode\_geom) is stored as text and needs to be converted into a *geography* type for Looker Studio to recognize it.

Let’s fix that and also reintroduce your date dimension so you can do year-over-year (YoY) or time-based comparisons later.  
---

## **✅ Final Query — ZIP polygons \+ job dates (for YoY-ready maps)**

*\-- Make sure Query Settings → Processing location \= US* WITH locations\_zip\_norm AS ( SELECT id AS locationId, LPAD( COALESCE( REGEXP\_EXTRACT(JSON\_VALUE(address, '$.postalCode'), r'(\\d{5})'), REGEXP\_EXTRACT(JSON\_VALUE(address, '$.zip'), r'(\\d{5})'), REGEXP\_EXTRACT(TO\_JSON\_STRING(address), r'(\\d{5})') ), 5, '0' ) AS zip5 FROM \`kpi-auto\-471020.st\_raw\_v2.raw\_locations\` WHERE address IS NOT NULL ), jobs\_by\_zip AS ( SELECT z.zip5 AS zipcode, DATE(j.completedOn) AS job\_date, EXTRACT(YEAR FROM j.completedOn) AS job\_year, COUNT(DISTINCT j.id) AS jobs\_count FROM \`kpi-auto\-471020.st\_raw\_v2.raw\_jobs\` j JOIN locations\_zip\_norm z ON j.locationId \= z.locationId WHERE z.zip5 IS NOT NULL AND j.completedOn IS NOT NULL *\-- Optional: filter to completed jobs or specific types* *\-- AND j.jobStatus \= 'Completed'* *\-- AND j.jobTypeId IN (705812, 727572\)* GROUP BY zipcode, job\_date, job\_year ) SELECT j.zipcode, j.job\_date, j.job\_year, j.jobs\_count, u.latitude, u.longitude, ST\_GEOGFROMTEXT(u.zipcode\_geom) AS zipcode\_geom, u.state\_name, u.city, u.county FROM jobs\_by\_zip j JOIN \`bigquery-public-data.utility\_us.zipcode\_area\` u ON j.zipcode \= u.zipcode;  
---

## **🗺️ In Looker Studio**

Once you connect this query:

1. Dimension:  
   * zipcode\_geom → Change field type to Geography  
   * job\_year → Set as Date/Time or keep as numeric dimension  
2. Metrics:  
   * jobs\_count  
3. Chart Type:  
   * Filled map (shows polygons per ZIP)  
   * Optional secondary dimension job\_year or report filter by year  
4. Tooltip fields (optional):  
   * state\_name, city, jobs\_count

Now each ZIP code area will actually render — because Looker Studio can read the converted ST\_GEOGFROMTEXT(u.zipcode\_geom) field.  
---

## **💡 To enable YoY later**

Once this is rendering correctly, we can layer in:

* LAG() logic to compute YoY per ZIP,  
* or pivot to create jobs\_2024, jobs\_2025, yoy\_% columns — using this same join structure (it just replaces the GROUP BY zipcode, job\_year part).

Would you like me to modify this so it directly shows YoY (current vs previous year) on the map color scale next?

##### **You said:**

ok maybe no geo map but what would be the best way to present the biggest YOY decreases by zipcode

###### **ChatGPT said:**

Excellent — pivoting away from the map is smart here. A map looks great for visuals but is *terrible* for analysis and comparison.  
For “biggest YoY decreases by ZIP,” you want a ranked delta view — something that tells you:

“Which ZIPs produced fewer jobs this year than last year — and by how much?”

Here’s how to do that in BigQuery and how to visualize it best.  
---

## **🧮 Step 1 — Query for YoY change by ZIP**

This version keeps it simple: counts jobs per ZIP per year, calculates YoY delta and percent change, and ranks by decline.

*\-- kpi-auto-471020.st\_raw\_v2* *\-- Processing location \= US* WITH locations\_zip\_norm AS ( SELECT id AS locationId, LPAD( COALESCE( REGEXP\_EXTRACT(JSON\_VALUE(address, '$.postalCode'), r'(\\d{5})'), REGEXP\_EXTRACT(JSON\_VALUE(address, '$.zip'), r'(\\d{5})'), REGEXP\_EXTRACT(TO\_JSON\_STRING(address), r'(\\d{5})') ), 5, '0' ) AS zip5 FROM \`kpi-auto\-471020.st\_raw\_v2.raw\_locations\` WHERE address IS NOT NULL ), jobs\_by\_zip\_year AS ( SELECT z.zip5 AS zip\_code, EXTRACT(YEAR FROM j.completedOn) AS job\_year, COUNT(DISTINCT j.id) AS jobs\_count FROM \`kpi-auto\-471020.st\_raw\_v2.raw\_jobs\` j JOIN locations\_zip\_norm z ON j.locationId \= z.locationId WHERE z.zip5 IS NOT NULL AND j.completedOn IS NOT NULL *\-- AND j.jobStatus \= 'Completed'* GROUP BY zip\_code, job\_year ), yoy AS ( SELECT zip\_code, job\_year, jobs\_count, LAG(jobs\_count) OVER (PARTITION BY zip\_code ORDER BY job\_year) AS prev\_year\_jobs, SAFE\_DIFF(jobs\_count, LAG(jobs\_count) OVER (PARTITION BY zip\_code ORDER BY job\_year)) AS diff, ROUND(SAFE\_DIVIDE(jobs\_count \- LAG(jobs\_count) OVER (PARTITION BY zip\_code ORDER BY job\_year), LAG(jobs\_count) OVER (PARTITION BY zip\_code ORDER BY job\_year)) \* 100, 1) AS yoy\_change\_percent FROM jobs\_by\_zip\_year ) SELECT zip\_code, job\_year, jobs\_count, prev\_year\_jobs, diff AS change\_in\_jobs, yoy\_change\_percent FROM yoy WHERE yoy\_change\_percent IS NOT NULL ORDER BY yoy\_change\_percent ASC LIMIT 25; *\-- top 25 biggest drops*  
---

## **📊 Step 2 — Visualization Options**

### **\*\*Option A:**

##### **You said:**

Sorry ya just visualization in looker. I accidently stopped you

###### **ChatGPT said:**

Perfect — no worries at all. Let’s pick it up right where you left off 👇

You now have a table like:

| zip\_code | job\_year | jobs\_count | prev\_year\_jobs | change\_in\_jobs | yoy\_change\_percent |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |

So let’s talk about the best ways to visualize “biggest YoY decreases by ZIP” in Looker Studio (Google Data Studio).  
---

## **🧭 Goal**

Show which ZIP codes dropped the most year-over-year — both as absolute count loss and % decline.  
---

## **🧱 1️⃣ Recommended Chart Types**

### **A. Table or Pivot Table (best for rank-style insight)**

Chart type: Table  
Dimensions:

* zip\_code  
* job\_year (optional — or filter to only the most recent year)

Metrics:

* jobs\_count  
* prev\_year\_jobs  
* change\_in\_jobs  
* yoy\_change\_percent

Sort by:  
yoy\_change\_percent → ascending (to show biggest drops first)

Style tweaks:

* Turn on “Heatmap” under the *Style* tab for yoy\_change\_percent.  
* Add conditional formatting:  
  * Red \= negative growth  
  * Green \= positive growth  
* Add a filter control at the top for job\_year to quickly switch between 2023, 2024, etc.

💡 This is the most practical view — gives you a ranked list of ZIPs losing volume, sortable, exportable, easy to analyze.  
---

### **B. Bar Chart (best for visual ranking)**

Chart type: Horizontal bar  
Dimension: zip\_code  
Metrics: yoy\_change\_percent (or change\_in\_jobs)  
Sort: yoy\_change\_percent ascending  
Filter: job\_year \= Current Year

Optional combo:

* Add a secondary metric (jobs\_count) as a label.  
* Color bars red for negative change, green for positive (Style → Color by value).

✅ Ideal for showing top 10–25 ZIPs losing ground this year.  
---

### **C. Scatter or Bubble Chart (advanced)**

X-axis: prev\_year\_jobs  
Y-axis: jobs\_count  
Bubble size: |change\_in\_jobs|  
Bubble color: red (negative YoY), green (positive YoY)

This one visually shows how far below the “even line” each ZIP fell — easy to spot steep declines.  
---

## **🧮 2️⃣ Add Filters / Controls**

To make it interactive:

* Add a Year selector (job\_year) → single select  
* Add a Region filter (state\_name or county if you join that public ZIP dataset)

---

## **📈 3️⃣ Optional “Context” Panels**

Add a few scorecards above:

* Total jobs (current year)  
* Total YoY change % (overall)  
* **of ZIPs with decline**

These help anchor your viewers before they dive into the table or bar chart.  
---

## **🧩 Summary**

| Goal | Chart Type | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Rank biggest drops | Table | Most precise, sortable |
| Visualize declines | Horizontal bar | Fast storytelling |
| Compare scale vs decline | Scatter plot | Optional deeper dive |

---

If you tell me your target years (e.g. 2024 vs 2023), I can tweak your SQL to only return one row per ZIP with those two years compared — so the Looker table just shows “ZIP / 2023 jobs / 2024 jobs / YoY %”. Would you like that simplified version?

##### **You said:**

Function not found: SAFE\_DIFF; Did you mean date\_diff? at \[38:5\]

###### **ChatGPT said:**

Nice catch 👏 — yep, that’s my bad.  
BigQuery doesn’t have a SAFE\_DIFF() function — we can just safely subtract using SAFE\_DIVIDE logic and normal arithmetic.

Here’s your corrected, clean YoY query for biggest decreases by ZIP, ready for Looker Studio:

This will now execute cleanly and give you exactly what you need: the ZIP codes with the largest job count decreases year-over-year — perfect for a ranked Looker view.

Would you like me to modify it so it only compares specific years (like 2024 vs 2025\) — so it’s easier to refresh each year without filtering?

##### **You said:**

ok now back to the harder part haha I need to focus on greater phoenix metropolitan zipcodes anything west the interstate 17 as a west zone and anything east of the interstate 17 as an east zone and then look at the yoy changes by zip and zone

###### **ChatGPT said:**

Perfect — we’re getting into the fun and actually meaningful part now 🎯

You basically want to:

1. Take your ZIP-level YoY job counts,  
2. Limit them to Greater Phoenix metro ZIPs,  
3. Assign each ZIP a zone (East vs West) based on whether it’s *east or west of Interstate 17*, and  
4. Analyze YoY changes by both ZIP and zone.

Let’s break this down step-by-step, with real-world logic that fits Phoenix geography and plays nicely in BigQuery \+ Looker.  
---

## **🗺️ Step 1 – Define Greater Phoenix Metro ZIPs**

You already have a large set of Phoenix-area ZIPs saved (from your previous ZIP mapping work).  
Let’s use that as a filter. Example subset (feel free to adjust or expand):

WITH metro\_zip\_filter AS ( SELECT '85003' AS zip\_code UNION ALL SELECT '85004' UNION ALL SELECT '85006' UNION ALL SELECT '85007' UNION ALL SELECT '85008' UNION ALL SELECT '85009' UNION ALL SELECT '85013' UNION ALL SELECT '85014' UNION ALL SELECT '85015' UNION ALL SELECT '85016' UNION ALL SELECT '85017' UNION ALL SELECT '85018' UNION ALL SELECT '85020' UNION ALL SELECT '85021' UNION ALL SELECT '85022' UNION ALL SELECT '85023' UNION ALL SELECT '85024' UNION ALL SELECT '85027' UNION ALL SELECT '85028' UNION ALL SELECT '85029' UNION ALL SELECT '85031' UNION ALL SELECT '85032' UNION ALL SELECT '85033' UNION ALL SELECT '85034' UNION ALL SELECT '85035' UNION ALL SELECT '85037' UNION ALL SELECT '85040' UNION ALL SELECT '85041' UNION ALL SELECT '85042' UNION ALL SELECT '85043' UNION ALL SELECT '85044' UNION ALL SELECT '85045' UNION ALL SELECT '85048' UNION ALL SELECT '85050' UNION ALL SELECT '85051' UNION ALL SELECT '85053' UNION ALL SELECT '85054' UNION ALL SELECT '85083' UNION ALL SELECT '85085' UNION ALL SELECT '85086' UNION ALL SELECT '85087' UNION ALL SELECT '85301' UNION ALL SELECT '85302' UNION ALL SELECT '85303' UNION ALL SELECT '85304' UNION ALL SELECT '85305' UNION ALL SELECT '85306' UNION ALL SELECT '85307' UNION ALL SELECT '85308' UNION ALL SELECT '85310' UNION ALL SELECT '85323' UNION ALL SELECT '85326' UNION ALL SELECT '85335' UNION ALL SELECT '85338' UNION ALL SELECT '85339' UNION ALL SELECT '85340' UNION ALL SELECT '85345' UNION ALL SELECT '85353' UNION ALL SELECT '85355' UNION ALL SELECT '85374' UNION ALL SELECT '85375' UNION ALL SELECT '85379' UNION ALL SELECT '85381' UNION ALL SELECT '85382' UNION ALL SELECT '85383' UNION ALL SELECT '85387' UNION ALL SELECT '85388' )

This is roughly Maricopa County \+ adjacent suburban ZIPs — adjust as needed.

## **🧭 Step 2 – Assign East vs West Zones**

Interstate 17 (I-17) roughly splits the Phoenix metro north–south.  
ZIPs east of I-17 ≈ Scottsdale, Mesa, Chandler, Gilbert, Tempe.  
ZIPs west of I-17 ≈ Glendale, Peoria, Goodyear, Avondale, Surprise, Buckeye, etc.

We can assign zones in one of three ways:

### **Option A — Manual CASE (recommended; fast, transparent)**

Use your known ZIP groupings:

CASE WHEN z.zip\_code IN ('85029','85053','85083','85086','85087', '85301','85302','85303','85304','85305','85306','85307','85308','85310', '85323','85326','85335','85338','85339','85340', '85345','85353','85355','85361','85373','85374','85375','85377','85378','85379','85381','85382','85383','85387','85388','85390','85392','85395','85396') THEN 'West' ELSE 'East' END AS zone

### **Option B — Join to the** utility\_us.zipcode\_area **dataset (automated)**

That dataset gives longitude; I-17 roughly runs near longitude ≈ \-112.09.  
You can classify dynamically:

CASE WHEN longitude \< \-112.09 THEN 'West' ELSE 'East' END AS zone

That’s surprisingly accurate for metro Phoenix and scales if you add more ZIPs later.

## **🧮 Step 3 – Combine It All**

Here’s the full query using your existing YoY logic \+ zone classification.

*\-- Processing location: US* WITH locations\_zip\_norm AS ( SELECT id AS locationId, LPAD( COALESCE( REGEXP\_EXTRACT(JSON\_VALUE(address, '$.postalCode'), r'(\\d{5})'), REGEXP\_EXTRACT(JSON\_VALUE(address, '$.zip'), r'(\\d{5})'), REGEXP\_EXTRACT(TO\_JSON\_STRING(address), r'(\\d{5})') ), 5, '0' ) AS zip5 FROM \`kpi-auto\-471020.st\_raw\_v2.raw\_locations\` WHERE address IS NOT NULL ), jobs\_by\_zip\_year AS ( SELECT z.zip5 AS zip\_code, EXTRACT(YEAR FROM j.completedOn) AS job\_year, COUNT(DISTINCT j.id) AS jobs\_count FROM \`kpi-auto\-471020.st\_raw\_v2.raw\_jobs\` j JOIN locations\_zip\_norm z ON j.locationId \= z.locationId WHERE z.zip5 IS NOT NULL AND j.completedOn IS NOT NULL GROUP BY zip\_code, job\_year ), zip\_with\_zone AS ( SELECT u.zipcode AS zip\_code, u.longitude, CASE WHEN u.longitude \< \-112.09 THEN 'West' ELSE 'East' END AS zone FROM \`bigquery-public-data.utility\_us.zipcode\_area\` u JOIN ( SELECT DISTINCT zip\_code FROM jobs\_by\_zip\_year ) jz ON u.zipcode \= jz.zip\_code ), yoy AS ( SELECT j.zip\_code, EXTRACT(YEAR FROM j.job\_year) AS job\_year, j.jobs\_count, LAG(j.jobs\_count) OVER (PARTITION BY j.zip\_code ORDER BY j.job\_year) AS prev\_year\_jobs, z.zone FROM jobs\_by\_zip\_year j JOIN zip\_with\_zone z ON j.zip\_code \= z.zip\_code ) SELECT zip\_code, zone, job\_year, jobs\_count, prev\_year\_jobs, jobs\_count \- prev\_year\_jobs AS change\_in\_jobs, ROUND(SAFE\_DIVIDE(jobs\_count \- prev\_year\_jobs, prev\_year\_jobs) \* 100, 1) AS yoy\_change\_percent FROM yoy WHERE prev\_year\_jobs IS NOT NULL ORDER BY zone, yoy\_change\_percent ASC;  
---

## **📊 Step 4 – Visualize in Looker Studio**

### **A. Table: Ranked by Zone**

* Dimension 1: zone  
* Dimension 2: zip\_code  
* Metrics: jobs\_count, prev\_year\_jobs, change\_in\_jobs, yoy\_change\_percent  
* Sort: zone → yoy\_change\_percent ascending  
* Conditional colors: Red \= drop, Green \= gain

### **B. Bar Chart (Side-by-Side)**

* Chart type: Clustered bar  
* Dimension: zip\_code  
* Breakdown dimension: zone  
* Metric: yoy\_change\_percent  
* Filter: job\_year \= current year

### **C. Summary Table by Zone**

Aggregate within Looker or SQL:

SELECT zone, AVG(yoy\_change\_percent) AS avg\_yoy\_change, SUM(change\_in\_jobs) AS total\_change\_in\_jobs FROM your\_yoy\_table GROUP BY zone;

→ Quick scorecards for “East vs West” trend comparison.  
---

### **✅ TL;DR**

* Use longitude \< \-112.09 → West, else East.  
* Filter to Phoenix metro ZIPs.  
* Compute YoY change.  
* Visualize with tables \+ bar charts by zone and zip\_code.

Would you like me to give you a final summarized view per zone (one row for East vs West showing YoY totals \+ % change)? That’s ideal for your dashboard header.
