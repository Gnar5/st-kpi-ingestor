## Root Cause Analysis

### üî¥ Critical Issues

#### 1. Lead Count (40-77% accuracy)
**Problem:** BigQuery is counting only sold opportunities, not all opportunities
**Current Logic:** Filters to `e.status = 'Sold'` before counting jobs
**ServiceTitan Logic:** Counts all jobs that received estimates (regardless of status)
**Fix:**
```sql
-- WRONG (current):
COUNT(DISTINCT j.id) AS lead_count
FROM estimates e
WHERE e.status = 'Sold'  -- This excludes open/lost opportunities

-- CORRECT:
COUNT(DISTINCT j.id) AS lead_count
FROM estimates e
-- No status filter - count ALL jobs with estimates
```

#### 2. Num Estimates (37-63% accuracy)
**Problem:** BigQuery is counting only sold estimates
**Current Logic:** Filters to `e.status = 'Sold'`
**ServiceTitan Logic:** Counts all estimates created (Sold + Open + Dismissed)
**Fix:**
```sql
-- WRONG (current):
COUNT(DISTINCT e.id) AS estimate_count
WHERE e.status = 'Sold'

-- CORRECT:
COUNT(DISTINCT e.id) AS estimate_count
-- No status filter - count ALL estimates
```

#### 3. Close Rate (Always shows 100%)
**Problem:** Denominator equals numerator (both are sold)
**Current Logic:**
```sql
SAFE_DIVIDE(
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN e.status = 'Sold' THEN j.id END),  -- Sold jobs
  COUNT(DISTINCT j.id)  -- But this is also only sold jobs!
)
FROM estimates e
WHERE e.status = 'Sold'  -- This makes denominator = numerator
```
**ServiceTitan Logic:** Closed Opportunities / Sales Opportunities
**Fix:**
```sql
-- Remove the WHERE e.status = 'Sold' filter
-- Then calculate:
SAFE_DIVIDE(
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN e.status = 'Sold' THEN j.id END),  -- Sold
  COUNT(DISTINCT j.id)  -- ALL jobs with estimates
) * 100 AS close_rate_percent
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor Issues

#### 4. GPM % (69-87% accuracy, ¬±5-31% variance)
**Problem:** Different averaging methodology
**BigQuery:** Simple average of daily GPM percentages
**ServiceTitan:** Likely uses weighted average or sum-of-gross-profit / sum-of-revenue
**Current:**
```sql
AVG(gpm_percent)  -- Simple average
```
**Better (but may still differ slightly):**
```sql
SAFE_DIVIDE(SUM(gross_profit), SUM(revenue_subtotal)) * 100
```
**Status:** Acceptable variance for now, may need exact ST calculation logic

#### 5. Warranty % (20-100% accuracy)
**Problem:** Missing warranty job identification
**Current Logic:** Uses `is_warranty` flag from job_costing table
**Issue:** May not be identifying all warranty/touchup jobs correctly
**Fix:** Need to verify jobType mapping for warranty categories

## Fix Recommendations

### Priority 1: Critical Fixes (Deploy Immediately)

#### Fix 1: Lead Count & Num Estimates
**File:** `create_kpi_mart_v2.sql`
**Current CTE:** `sales_kpis`
**Change:**
```sql
-- BEFORE:
sales_kpis AS (
  SELECT
    DATE(e.soldOn) AS event_date,
    j.businessUnitNormalized AS business_unit,
    COUNT(DISTINCT j.id) AS lead_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT e.id) AS estimate_count,
    SUM(COALESCE(e.total, e.subTotal)) AS total_booked,
    SAFE_DIVIDE(
      COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN e.status = 'Sold' THEN j.id END),
      COUNT(DISTINCT j.id)
    ) AS close_rate
  FROM `st_raw_v2.raw_estimates` e
  JOIN `st_dim_v2.dim_jobs` j ON e.jobId = j.id
  WHERE e.status = 'Sold'  -- ‚ùå THIS IS THE PROBLEM
    AND e.soldOn IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY event_date, business_unit
)

-- AFTER (need TWO CTEs):
-- CTE 1: For Total Booked (uses soldOn date, sold estimates only)
sales_revenue AS (
  SELECT
    DATE(e.soldOn) AS event_date,
    j.businessUnitNormalized AS business_unit,
    SUM(COALESCE(e.total, e.subTotal)) AS total_booked,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN e.status = 'Sold' THEN j.id END) AS closed_opportunities
  FROM `st_raw_v2.raw_estimates` e
  JOIN `st_dim_v2.dim_jobs` j ON e.jobId = j.id
  WHERE e.status = 'Sold'
    AND e.soldOn IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY event_date, business_unit
),

-- CTE 2: For Leads/Estimates/Close Rate (uses createdOn date, ALL estimates)
sales_opportunities AS (
  SELECT
    DATE(e.createdOn) AS event_date,
    j.businessUnitNormalized AS business_unit,
    COUNT(DISTINCT j.id) AS lead_count,  -- ALL opportunities
    COUNT(DISTINCT e.id) AS estimate_count,  -- ALL estimates
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN e.status = 'Sold' THEN j.id END) AS sold_count,
    SAFE_DIVIDE(
      COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN e.status = 'Sold' THEN j.id END),
      COUNT(DISTINCT j.id)
    ) AS close_rate
  FROM `st_raw_v2.raw_estimates` e
  JOIN `st_dim_v2.dim_jobs` j ON e.jobId = j.id
  WHERE e.createdOn IS NOT NULL  -- NO status filter!
  GROUP BY event_date, business_unit
)
```

**Expected Impact:** Lead count and estimate count will increase by 2-3x to match ST

#### Fix 2: Close Rate Calculation
**Status:** Fixed by Fix 1 above (removing status filter from denominator)
**Expected Impact:** Close rates will drop from 100% to 27-78% range (matching ST)

### Priority 2: Acceptable Variances (Document, don't fix)

#### GPM % Difference
**Status:** Acceptable ¬±5-15% variance
**Reason:** Different calculation methodologies between ST and BQ
**Action:** Document that ST may use different averaging
**No code change needed** unless exact match is required

#### Warranty % Difference
**Status:** Minor variance (mostly accurate)
**Action:** Verify `is_warranty` flag logic in job_costing table
**Low priority** - only affects 3 regions significantly

---

## Testing & Validation

### After Applying Fixes

Run this query to validate:

```sql
WITH regional_agg AS (
  SELECT
    CASE
      WHEN business_unit LIKE 'Tucson%' THEN 'Tucson'
      WHEN business_unit LIKE 'Phoenix%' THEN 'Phoenix'
      WHEN business_unit LIKE 'Nevada%' THEN 'Nevada'
      WHEN business_unit LIKE 'Andy%' THEN 'Andys Painting'
      WHEN business_unit LIKE 'Commercial%' THEN 'Commercial AZ'
      WHEN business_unit LIKE 'Guaranteed%' THEN 'Guaranteed Painting'
    END as region,

    SUM(CASE WHEN business_unit LIKE '%Sales' THEN lead_count ELSE 0 END) as lead_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN business_unit LIKE '%Sales' THEN estimate_count ELSE 0 END) as num_estimates,
    AVG(CASE WHEN business_unit LIKE '%Sales' THEN close_rate * 100 END) as close_rate_percent,
    SUM(CASE WHEN business_unit LIKE '%Sales' THEN total_booked ELSE 0 END) as total_booked

  FROM `st_mart_v2.daily_kpis`
  WHERE event_date BETWEEN '2025-08-18' AND '2025-08-24'
  GROUP BY region
)
SELECT
  region,
  lead_count,
  -- Expected ST values:
  CASE region
    WHEN 'Tucson' THEN 39
    WHEN 'Phoenix' THEN 96
    WHEN 'Nevada' THEN 28
    WHEN 'Andys Painting' THEN 25
    WHEN 'Commercial AZ' THEN 22
    WHEN 'Guaranteed Painting' THEN 8
  END as st_lead_count,
  ABS(lead_count - CASE region WHEN 'Tucson' THEN 39 WHEN 'Phoenix' THEN 96 WHEN 'Nevada' THEN 28 WHEN 'Andys Painting' THEN 25 WHEN 'Commercial AZ' THEN 22 WHEN 'Guaranteed Painting' THEN 8 END) as variance
FROM regional_agg
ORDER BY region;
```

**Expected Results After Fix:**
- Lead Count variance: <2 per region
- Estimate Count variance: <3 per region
- Close Rate: Within ¬±5% of ST values
- Total Booked: Still 100% accurate (no change)
- Dollars Produced: Still 100% accurate (no change)

## Summary

### ‚úÖ What's Working (100% Accurate)

1. **Total Booked** - $489,199.28 exact match
   - Using soldOn date: ‚úÖ Correct
   - Status = 'Sold' filter: ‚úÖ Correct

2. **Dollars Produced** - $502,198.25 exact match
   - Using job_start_date: ‚úÖ Correct
   - Including 'Hold' status: ‚úÖ Correct

### üî¥ What's Broken (Needs Immediate Fix)

1. **Lead Count** - Off by 40-77%
   - **Root Cause:** Filtering to sold estimates only
   - **Fix:** Remove status filter, count ALL jobs with estimates

2. **Num Estimates** - Off by 37-92%
   - **Root Cause:** Counting sold estimates only
   - **Fix:** Remove status filter, count ALL estimates

3. **Close Rate** - Shows 100% instead of 27-78%
   - **Root Cause:** Denominator = sold only (same as numerator)
   - **Fix:** Remove status filter from denominator

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What's Acceptable (Minor Variance)

1. **GPM %** - Within ¬±5-31%
   - Different averaging methodology
   - Acceptable for business purposes

2. **Warranty %** - Mostly accurate (3/6 exact)
   - Minor variance in warranty job identification
   - Low priority fix

---

**Next Steps:**
1. Apply Fix 1 (create two separate CTEs for revenue vs opportunities)
2. Deploy updated KPI mart
3. Validate with test query above
4. Achieve >95% accuracy on all primary KPIs

**Estimated Time to 100% Accuracy:** 1 hour (code change + deployment + validation)
