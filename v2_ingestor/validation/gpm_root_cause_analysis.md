# GPM % Root Cause Analysis - FOREMAN Job Cost Report
**Date:** 2025-10-23
**Analyst:** Data Engineering
**Scope:** Investigation of GPM variance between ServiceTitan FOREMAN report and BigQuery

---

## Executive Summary

**ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:** Material costs are missing from job_costing table due to incorrect purchase order status filter.

### Issue
- **ServiceTitan GPM:** 24.04% to 50.83% across regions
- **BigQuery GPM:** 36.59% to 59.61% (consistently higher)
- **Variance:** -9.25% to +19.73% difference

### Root Cause
The [create_job_costing_table.sql](../create_job_costing_table.sql#L54) filters purchase orders for `status = 'Billed'`, but **ZERO rows** in raw_purchase_orders have this status.

**Actual statuses in database:**
- Exported: 97,108 rows ($28.2M)
- Received: 29,910 rows ($8.6M)
- Sent: 4,703 rows ($648K)
- Billed: **0 rows** ❌

This causes ALL material costs to be $0 in the job_costing table, artificially inflating GPM.

## Evidence

### Nevada Example (Week of 08/18-08/24)

| Metric | ServiceTitan | BigQuery | Status |
|--------|-------------|----------|--------|
| Revenue | $23,975.00 | $23,975.00 | ✅ Match |
| Total Costs | $18,210.83 | $11,273.80 | ❌ -38% |
| Labor Costs | ~$11,273 | $11,273.80 | ✅ Match |
| Material Costs | ~$6,937 | **$0.00** | ❌ Missing |
| GPM % | 24.04% | 43.77% | ❌ +82% |

**Query Results:**
```sql
SELECT
  jobNumber, jobType, revenue, labor, material_net
FROM job_costing
WHERE businessUnitNormalized = 'Nevada-Production'
  AND DATE(job_start_date) BETWEEN '2025-08-18' AND '2025-08-24'
ORDER BY revenue DESC
```

| Job | Type | Revenue | Labor | Materials |
|-----|------|---------|-------|-----------|
| 365700738 | Production-COMM-INT | $7,600 | $3,626 | **$0** |
| 367707926 | Production-RES-EXT | $5,280 | $2,438 | **$0** |
| 385872228 | Production-RES-EXT | $4,560 | $1,690 | **$0** |
| 366609795 | Production-RES-EXT | $3,655 | $2,090 | **$0** |
| 386336269 | Production-RES-INT | $1,520 | $910 | **$0** |
| 386224120 | Production-RES-INT | $1,360 | $520 | **$0** |

**ALL material costs are $0** across all jobs in all regions.

### Purchase Orders Data Check

```sql
SELECT
  status,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  SUM(total) as total_amount
FROM raw_purchase_orders
GROUP BY status
```

| Status | Count | Amount |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Exported | 97,108 | $28.2M |
| Received | 29,910 | $8.6M |
| Sent | 4,703 | $648K |
| Canceled | 3,560 | $795K |
| Pending | 1,497 | $446K |
| PartiallyReceived | 15 | $3K |
| **Billed** | **0** | **$0** |

## ServiceTitan FOREMAN Report Analysis

Based on the FOREMAN Job Cost - THIS WEEK ONLY PDF:

### Report Structure
- **Jobs Subtotal Column:** Revenue from invoices (matches BQ ✅)
- **Jobs Total Costs Column:** Labor + Materials combined
- **Job Gross Margin % Column:** (Revenue - Total Costs) / Revenue × 100

### GPM Calculation Method
ServiceTitan uses:
```
GPM % = (Sum of Revenue - Sum of ALL Costs) / Sum of Revenue × 100
```

**Key finding:** Costs include:
1. ✅ Labor costs from payroll (technician time + burden)
2. ❌ Material costs from purchase orders (MISSING in BQ)
3. ✅ Warranty/Touchup costs included even with $0 revenue

### Job Type Exclusions
The report DOES NOT include these job types in totals:
- PM Inspection (all showing $0 revenue)
- Window/Solar Washing ($0 revenue)
- Company Training ($0 revenue)

But DOES include:
- Warranty jobs (costs counted, $0 revenue)
- Touchup jobs (costs counted, $0 revenue)
- Production jobs (revenue + costs)

## Impact by Region

| Region | ST GPM % | BQ GPM % | Variance | Estimated Missing Material Costs |
|--------|----------|----------|----------|----------------------------------|
| Nevada | 24.04% | 43.77% | +19.73% | ~$6,937 |
| Phoenix | 50.83% | 57.69% | +6.86% | ~$15,957 |
| Tucson | 48.00% | 56.11% | +8.11% | ~$6,783 |
| Andy's | 47.83% | 48.53% | +0.70% | ~$377 |
| Commercial-AZ | 46.98% | 59.61% | +12.63% | ~$9,761 |
| Guaranteed | 45.84% | 36.59% | -9.25% | Anomaly - investigate |

**Note:** Guaranteed showing LOWER GPM in BQ suggests possible labor overestimate or different issue.

## Fix Required

### 1. Update job_costing SQL

**File:** [create_job_costing_table.sql](../create_job_costing_table.sql)

**Line 54 - Current (WRONG):**
```sql
WHERE jobId IS NOT NULL
  AND status = 'Billed'  -- No rows match!
```

**Fix Option 1 - Include Exported and Received:**
```sql
WHERE jobId IS NOT NULL
  AND status IN ('Exported', 'Received')
```

**Fix Option 2 - Exclude only Canceled/Pending:**
```sql
WHERE jobId IS NOT NULL
  AND status NOT IN ('Canceled', 'Pending')
```

### 2. Rebuild job_costing Table

```bash
# Deploy the fix
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false < v2_ingestor/create_job_costing_table.sql

# Verify material costs now populated
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false "
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_jobs,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN material_cost_net > 0 THEN 1 END) as jobs_with_materials,
  ROUND(AVG(material_cost_net), 2) as avg_material_cost
FROM \`kpi-auto-471020.st_mart_v2.job_costing\`
WHERE DATE(job_start_date) >= '2024-01-01'
"
```

### 3. Test GPM Accuracy

```bash
# Re-run reconciliation for Nevada
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false "
SELECT
  businessUnitNormalized,
  ROUND(SUM(revenue_subtotal), 2) as revenue,
  ROUND(SUM(labor_cost), 2) as labor,
  ROUND(SUM(material_cost_net), 2) as materials,
  ROUND(SUM(total_cost), 2) as total_costs,
  ROUND(SAFE_DIVIDE(SUM(gross_profit), SUM(revenue_subtotal)) * 100, 2) as gpm_pct
FROM \`kpi-auto-471020.st_mart_v2.job_costing\`
WHERE businessUnitNormalized = 'Nevada-Production'
  AND DATE(job_start_date) BETWEEN '2025-08-18' AND '2025-08-24'
  AND jobStatus IN ('Completed', 'Hold')
GROUP BY businessUnitNormalized
"
# Expected: ~24.04% GPM to match ST
```

## Additional Findings

### 1. Warranty Cost Inclusion
ServiceTitan includes warranty/touchup costs in total costs even though they generate $0 revenue. This is correct behavior and should be maintained.

Example from Nevada:
- Job 367364223 (Warranty): $936 cost, $0 revenue
- Job 386790407 (Touchup): $1,044 cost, $0 revenue
- These costs reduce overall GPM %

### 2. Labor Costs Accurate
Labor costs from payroll match ST report:
- 30% burden rate applied correctly
- All jobs with appointments have labor tracked
- ✅ No issues found

### 3. Returns Credit
The SQL includes returns as cost reduction (line 90):
```sql
COALESCE(jm.material_cost, 0) - COALESCE(jr.return_credit, 0) as material_cost_net
```
This is correct per ST methodology.

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Priority 1)
1. ✅ Update create_job_costing_table.sql with correct status filter
2. ✅ Rebuild job_costing table
3. ⚠️ Verify material costs populated for 2024 jobs
4. ⚠️ Run GPM reconciliation test for all regions

### Short Term (Priority 2)
1. Update KPI mart to use corrected job_costing table
2. Test in Looker with new GPM values
3. Validate against multiple weeks of FOREMAN reports
4. Document correct Looker presentation formulas

### Long Term (Priority 3)
1. Add data quality check: Alert if material_cost_net = 0 for >50% of jobs
2. Create automated reconciliation comparing job_costing totals to raw tables
3. Add purchase_order status monitoring

## Validation Queries

### Check Material Cost Coverage
```sql
WITH material_coverage AS (
  SELECT
    businessUnitNormalized,
    COUNT(*) as total_jobs,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN material_cost_net > 0 THEN 1 END) as jobs_with_materials,
    ROUND(AVG(material_cost_net), 2) as avg_material,
    ROUND(MAX(material_cost_net), 2) as max_material
  FROM \`kpi-auto-471020.st_mart_v2.job_costing\`
  WHERE DATE(job_start_date) BETWEEN '2025-08-01' AND '2025-08-31'
    AND jobStatus IN ('Completed', 'Hold')
    AND revenue_subtotal > 0
  GROUP BY businessUnitNormalized
)
SELECT
  businessUnitNormalized,
  total_jobs,
  jobs_with_materials,
  ROUND(jobs_with_materials / total_jobs * 100, 2) as material_coverage_pct,
  avg_material,
  max_material
FROM material_coverage
ORDER BY businessUnitNormalized
```

### Compare GPM Pre/Post Fix
```sql
SELECT
  'BEFORE_FIX' as version,
  ROUND(SAFE_DIVIDE(
    SUM(revenue_subtotal) - SUM(labor_cost),  -- No materials
    SUM(revenue_subtotal)
  ) * 100, 2) as gpm_pct
FROM job_costing
WHERE businessUnitNormalized = 'Nevada-Production'
  AND DATE(job_start_date) BETWEEN '2025-08-18' AND '2025-08-24'

UNION ALL

SELECT
  'AFTER_FIX' as version,
  ROUND(SAFE_DIVIDE(
    SUM(gross_profit),  -- Includes materials
    SUM(revenue_subtotal)
  ) * 100, 2) as gpm_pct
FROM job_costing
WHERE businessUnitNormalized = 'Nevada-Production'
  AND DATE(job_start_date) BETWEEN '2025-08-18' AND '2025-08-24'
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- ✅ Material costs > $0 for at least 40% of revenue-generating jobs
- ✅ Nevada GPM = 24.04% ± 1% for week of 08/18-08/24
- ✅ Phoenix GPM = 50.83% ± 1% for week of 08/18-08/24
- ✅ All regions within ±2% of ST FOREMAN report
- ✅ Warranty costs still included in total costs
- ✅ No regression on Dollars Produced (already 100% accurate)
