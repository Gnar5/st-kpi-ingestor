-- KPI 1: Leads (by job creation date)
-- ============================================================================
-- DEFINITION: Count of unique customers with estimate jobs created on event_date
-- LOGIC CHANGE (per senior eng directive):
--   - Case-insensitive substring match on 'estimate' in jobTypeName
--   - NO COMM exclusion (previously excluded COMM jobs, now includes all)
--   - Exclude customers with 'test' in name (case-insensitive)
--   - Sales BUs only
-- ============================================================================

-- ============================================================================
-- KPI 2: Total Booked (sum of sold estimate amounts by sold date)
-- ============================================================================
-- DEFINITION: Sum of ALL sold estimates on the date they were sold (Phoenix/Arizona timezone)
-- LOGIC CHANGE (per diagnostics analysis + user validation):
--   - Use soldOn date (not createdOn) - matches ST UI perfectly
--   - CRITICAL: Convert to America/Phoenix timezone before DATE() to match ST UI
--   - NO job type filter - includes ALL sold estimates (residential + commercial)
--   - Status must be 'Sold'
--   - Sales BUs only
-- RATIONALE:
--   1. User confirmed Nevada shows $27,150 with NO job type filter in ST UI
--   2. Timezone issue found: estimate 386522888 sold 6:02 PM Arizona time on Aug 18
--      but UTC timestamp shows Aug 19. ST UI uses local timezone.
-- VALIDATION:
--   Phoenix 8/18=$30,241.51 (exact match with timezone fix)
--   Tucson 8/18=$4,844.58 (exact match with timezone fix)
--   Nevada 8/18=$27,150.00 (exact match with timezone fix)
