-- st_mart_v2.opportunity_daily
-- Daily business unit summary of sales opportunities and close rate
--
-- Business Logic:
--   - Aggregates opportunity_jobs by opportunity_date and business unit
--   - Calculates close_rate = closed_opportunities / sales_opportunities * 100
--
-- Grain: One row per date per business unit
