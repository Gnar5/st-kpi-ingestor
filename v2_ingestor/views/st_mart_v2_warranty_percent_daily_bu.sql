-- st_mart_v2.warranty_percent_daily_bu
-- Daily warranty percentage by business unit for production work
-- VALIDATED AGAINST SERVICETITAN: Week 08/18-08/24/2025 matches exactly âœ“
--
-- Business Logic (validated):
--   - Warranty % = (Total Cost of Warranty/Touchup Jobs) / (Total Revenue) * 100
--   - Warranty jobs = jobs with jobTypeName IN ('Warranty', 'Touchup')
--   - Uses COST (labor + materials) not revenue (warranty jobs typically have $0 revenue)
--   - Revenue = Dollars Produced (sum of all production job revenue)
--   - Includes both Completed and Hold status production jobs
--   - Date based on job start_date
--
-- Grain: One row per date per business unit
