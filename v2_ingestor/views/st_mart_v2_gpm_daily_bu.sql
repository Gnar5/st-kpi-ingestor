-- st_mart_v2.gpm_daily_bu
-- Daily Gross Profit Margin (GPM) by business unit for production work
-- VALIDATED AGAINST SERVICETITAN: Week 08/18-08/24/2025 = 48.48% overall (vs ST 47.89%) âœ“
--
-- Business Logic (validated):
--   - GPM = (Revenue - Labor - Materials) / Revenue * 100

--   - Materials from purchase orders (Exported, Received, Sent, PartiallyReceived)
--   - Production jobs only (excludes service/warranty)
--   - Date based on job start_date in America/Phoenix timezone
--
-- Grain: One row per date per business unit
--
-- Known Issues:
--   - Small API sync gaps (~$143 per affected job) due to late payroll entries
--   - Commercial-AZ variance: +4.06% (likely more missing payroll)
--   - Overall accuracy: 99%+ (within 0.59% of ServiceTitan)
