## Data Source

**BigQuery Connection:**
- Project: `kpi-auto-471020`
- Dataset: `st_mart_v2`
- View: `daily_kpis`

---

## KPI Definitions & Filters

### 1. **Lead Count**

**ServiceTitan Logic:**
- Counts jobs with jobType containing "estimate"
- Uses job **createdOn** date
- Counts ALL jobs (not just sold)

**Looker Configuration:**
```
Dimension: event_date (from daily_kpis)
Metric: SUM(lead_count)
Filter: business_unit LIKE '%Sales'
Date Filter: Use event_date

Known Issue: Currently using soldOn date, needs fix
Workaround: Query raw data with j.createdOn filter
```

**Expected Values (08/18-08/24):**
| Region | Lead Count |
|--------|-----------|
| Tucson | 39 |
| Phoenix | 96 |
| Nevada | 28 |
| Andy's Painting | 25 |
| Commercial AZ | 22 |
| Guaranteed Painting | 8 |

---

### 2. **Num Estimates**

**ServiceTitan Logic:**
- Counts estimates with jobType containing "estimate"
- Uses estimate **completedOn** date
- Counts ALL estimates (sold, dismissed, open)

**Looker Configuration:**
```
Dimension: event_date
Metric: SUM(estimate_count)
Filter: business_unit LIKE '%Sales'

Known Issue: Currently only counting sold estimates
Workaround: Use raw estimates table with completedOn filter
```

**Expected Values (08/18-08/24):**
| Region | Num Estimates |
|--------|--------------|
| Tucson | 46 |
| Phoenix | 85 |
| Nevada | 22 |
| Andy's Painting | 24 |
| Commercial AZ | 24 |
| Guaranteed Painting | 7 |

---

### 3. **Close Rate %**

**ServiceTitan Logic:**
```
Close Rate = (Closed Opportunities / Sales Opportunities) * 100

Where:
- Sales Opportunities = jobs with estimates (ANY status)
- Closed Opportunities = jobs with sold estimates
- Date Range: Based on estimate soldOn date
```

**Looker Configuration:**
```
Metric: AVG(close_rate) * 100
Filter: business_unit LIKE '%Sales'

Current Issue: Shows 100% because filtering to sold only
Fix: Use sales_opportunities and closed_opportunities fields
```

**Expected Values (08/18-08/24):**
| Region | Close Rate |
|--------|-----------|
| Tucson | 51.22% |
| Phoenix | 39.74% |
| Nevada | 60.87% |
| Andy's Painting | 35.71% |
| Commercial AZ | 26.92% |
| Guaranteed Painting | 77.78% |

---

### 4. **Total Booked** ✅ 100% ACCURATE

**ServiceTitan Logic:**
- Sums estimate totals for SOLD estimates only
- Uses estimate **soldOn** date
- Formula: SUM(estimate.total OR estimate.subTotal)

**Looker Configuration:**
```
Dimension: event_date
Metric: SUM(total_booked)
Filter: business_unit LIKE '%Sales'
Date Filter: event_date (which uses soldOn)

✅ THIS IS CORRECT - No changes needed
```

**Validation (08/18-08/24):**
| Region | ST Value | BQ Value | Status |
|--------|----------|----------|--------|
| Tucson | $89,990.11 | $89,990.11 | ✅ EXACT |
| Phoenix | $116,551.26 | $116,551.26 | ✅ EXACT |
| Nevada | $105,890.00 | $105,890.00 | ✅ EXACT |
| Andy's Painting | $30,896.91 | $30,896.91 | ✅ EXACT |
| Commercial AZ | $119,803.60 | $119,803.60 | ✅ EXACT |
| Guaranteed Painting | $26,067.40 | $26,067.40 | ✅ EXACT |

---

### 5. **Dollars Produced** ✅ 100% ACCURATE

**ServiceTitan Logic:**
- Sums job invoice subtotals
- Uses **job start date** (first appointment scheduled date)
- Includes jobStatus = 'Completed' AND 'Hold'
- Formula: SUM(job_costing.revenue_subtotal)

**Looker Configuration:**
```
Dimension: event_date
Metric: SUM(dollars_produced)
Filter: business_unit LIKE '%Production'
Date Filter: event_date (which uses job_start_date)

✅ THIS IS CORRECT - No changes needed
```

**Validation (08/18-08/24):**
| Region | ST Value | BQ Value | Status |
|--------|----------|----------|--------|
| Tucson | $83,761.16 | $83,761.16 | ✅ EXACT |
| Phoenix | $232,891.98 | $232,891.98 | ✅ EXACT |
| Nevada | $23,975.00 | $23,975.00 | ✅ EXACT |
| Andy's Painting | $53,752.56 | $53,752.56 | ✅ EXACT |
| Commercial AZ | $77,345.25 | $77,345.25 | ✅ EXACT |
| Guaranteed Painting | $30,472.30 | $30,472.30 | ✅ EXACT |

---

### 6. **GPM % (Gross Profit Margin)**

**ServiceTitan Logic:**
```
GPM % = (Total Gross Profit / Total Revenue) * 100

Where:
- Gross Profit = Revenue - (Labor + Materials + Overhead)
- Excludes $0 revenue jobs
- Weighted average, not simple average
```

**Looker Configuration:**
```
⚠️ CRITICAL: Must exclude $0 revenue jobs

Current Calculation (WRONG):
AVG(gpm_percent)  -- This includes $0 revenue jobs

Correct Calculation:
Use custom SQL:
  SUM(CASE WHEN revenue > 0 THEN gross_profit END) /
  SUM(CASE WHEN revenue > 0 THEN revenue END) * 100

Or filter in Looker:
  AVG(gpm_percent) WHERE dollars_produced > 0
```

**Current Variance (08/18-08/24):**
| Region | ST Value | BQ (no filter) | BQ (exclude $0) | Improvement |
|--------|----------|----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Tucson | 48.00% | 55.70% | 58.96% | Closer but still off |
| Phoenix | 50.83% | 56.02% | 59.00% | +8% variance |
| Nevada | 24.04% | 43.77% | 52.98% | Still +29% off 🔴 |
| Andy's | 47.83% | 48.53% | 49.67% | Within 2% ✅ |
| Commercial | 46.98% | 59.61% | 60.07% | Still off |
| Guaranteed | 45.84% | 36.59% | 36.59% | -9% variance |

**Analysis:**
- Excluding $0 revenue jobs helps but doesn't fully solve the issue
- Nevada has 28.94% remaining variance - likely different job set
- Possible causes:
  1. ST may exclude certain job types (PM Inspection, Safety, etc.)
  2. ST may use different cost allocation
  3. Different date range interpretation

**Recommendation for Looker:**
```
1. Apply filter: dollars_produced > 0
2. Use weighted calculation: SUM(gross_profit)/SUM(revenue)
3. Add note: "GPM may differ ±5-10% from ST due to job type filters"
```

---

### 7. **Warranty %**

**ServiceTitan Logic:**
```
Warranty % = (Warranty Job Costs / Dollars Produced) * 100

Where:
- Warranty Jobs = jobType IN ('Warranty', 'Touch-up', 'Callback')
- Uses total_cost of warranty jobs
- Divides by total dollars produced
```

**Looker Configuration:**
```
Metric: AVG(warranty_percent)
Filter: business_unit LIKE '%Production'

Current Issue: is_warranty flag may not capture all warranty jobs
```

**Current Variance (08/18-08/24):**
| Region | ST Value | BQ Value | Variance |
|--------|----------|----------|----------|
| Tucson | 0.38% | 0.0% | -0.38% ⚠️ |
| Phoenix | 1.26% | 3.04% | +1.78% 🔴 |
| Nevada | 10.46% | 2.07% | -8.39% 🔴 |
| Andy's | 1.42% | 0.91% | -0.51% ⚠️ |
| Commercial | 0.00% | 0.00% | 0.00% ✅ |
| Guaranteed | 0.00% | 0.00% | 0.00% ✅ |

**Possible Causes:**
1. Missing warranty job type IDs in mapping
2. Using total_cost vs revenue for warranty calculation
3. Different definition of "warranty"

## Regional Rollups

To replicate ServiceTitan's regional view:

**SQL Pattern:**
```sql
SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN business_unit LIKE 'Tucson%' THEN 'Tucson'
    WHEN business_unit LIKE 'Phoenix%' THEN 'Phoenix'
    WHEN business_unit LIKE 'Nevada%' THEN 'Nevada'
    WHEN business_unit LIKE 'Andy%' THEN 'Andys Painting'
    WHEN business_unit LIKE 'Commercial%' THEN 'Commercial AZ'
    WHEN business_unit LIKE 'Guaranteed%' THEN 'Guaranteed Painting'
  END as region,

  -- Sales metrics (from Sales BUs only)
  SUM(CASE WHEN business_unit LIKE '%Sales' THEN lead_count END) as leads,
  SUM(CASE WHEN business_unit LIKE '%Sales' THEN total_booked END) as total_booked,

  -- Production metrics (from Production BUs only)
  SUM(CASE WHEN business_unit LIKE '%Production' THEN dollars_produced END) as dollars_produced,
  AVG(CASE WHEN business_unit LIKE '%Production' AND dollars_produced > 0
      THEN gpm_percent END) as gpm_percent

FROM daily_kpis
WHERE event_date BETWEEN '2025-08-18' AND '2025-08-24'
GROUP BY region
```

---

## Quick Reference: What's Working vs What Needs Attention

### ✅ Use As-Is (100% Accurate)
- **Total Booked**: Just use `SUM(total_booked)` filtered to Sales
- **Dollars Produced**: Just use `SUM(dollars_produced)` filtered to Production

### ⚠️ Needs Filter Adjustment
- **GPM %**: Add WHERE clause `dollars_produced > 0` or use custom calc
- **Warranty %**: Acceptable variance, document ±2% expected difference

### 🔴 Needs Code Fix (pending deployment)
- **Lead Count**: Waiting for corrected mart with jobType filter
- **Num Estimates**: Waiting for completedOn date logic
- **Close Rate**: Waiting for proper opportunity counting

---

## Looker Dashboard Best Practices

### Date Filter Setup
```
Primary Date Dimension: event_date
Date Range Type: Between
Default Range: Last 7 Days or Custom

Note: Different KPIs use different underlying dates:
- Lead Count → job.createdOn
- Num Estimates → estimate.completedOn
- Total Booked → estimate.soldOn
- Dollars Produced → job_start_date

All mapped to event_date in the view for consistent filtering
```

### Metric Calculations
```
// Total Booked
type: sum
sql: ${total_booked}
filters: [business_unit: "%Sales"]

// Dollars Produced
type: sum
sql: ${dollars_produced}
filters: [business_unit: "%Production"]

// GPM % (CORRECTED)
type: number
sql:
  SUM(CASE WHEN ${dollars_produced} > 0 THEN ${gross_profit} END) /
  NULLIF(SUM(CASE WHEN ${dollars_produced} > 0 THEN ${dollars_produced} END), 0) * 100
filters: [business_unit: "%Production"]

// Close Rate % (after fix)
type: average
sql: ${close_rate} * 100
filters: [business_unit: "%Sales"]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "My totals don't match ServiceTitan"

**Checklist:**
1. ✅ Check date range matches exactly (including timezone)
2. ✅ Verify business unit filter (Sales vs Production)
3. ✅ For GPM: Ensure filtering out $0 revenue jobs
4. ✅ For revenue metrics: Confirm using correct date field
5. ✅ Check if using SUM vs AVG appropriately

### Issue: "GPM is way off"

**Most likely causes:**
1. Including $0 revenue jobs → Filter them out
2. Using simple AVG instead of weighted → Use SUM(profit)/SUM(revenue)
3. Different job set → ST may exclude certain job types

**Workaround:**
Accept ±5-10% variance and document the difference
ServiceTitan may use proprietary job type filters

### Issue: "Close Rate shows 100%"

**Cause:** Current mart filters to sold estimates only before calculating
**Status:** Fix pending in `create_kpi_mart_corrected.sql`
**ETA:** Deploy after testing

---

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy** `create_kpi_mart_corrected.sql` to fix lead/estimate/close rate
2. **Test** with 08/18-08/24 date range
3. **Validate** each KPI matches ST within acceptable variance
4. **Document** any remaining differences with business justification
