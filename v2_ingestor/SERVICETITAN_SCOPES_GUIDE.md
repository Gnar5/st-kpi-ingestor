## Testing After Enabling Scopes

Once you've enabled the scopes, test each entity:

```bash
# Test campaigns (marketing scope)
curl http://localhost:8081/ingest/campaigns

# Test customers (CRM scope)
curl http://localhost:8081/ingest/customers

# Test jobs (JPM scope)
curl http://localhost:8081/ingest/jobs

# Test invoices (accounting scope)
curl http://localhost:8081/ingest/invoices
```

## Troubleshooting

### Still Getting 403 Errors?

1. **Wait 5 minutes** - Scope changes can take a few minutes to propagate
2. **Restart the service**:
   ```bash
   # Kill and restart
   npm start
   ```
3. **Verify scopes in portal** - Double-check all boxes are checked
4. **Check app status** - Make sure the app is "Active" or "Published"

### Which Scopes Are Absolutely Required?

**Minimum for basic functionality:**
- `jpm.jobs:read`
- `accounting.invoices:read`
- `crm.customers:read`
- `crm.locations:read`

**Recommended for full functionality:**
- All scopes listed in the main section above

### Getting "Invalid Scope" Errors?

Some scopes might not be available for your ServiceTitan account tier. Contact ServiceTitan support to enable enterprise/advanced API access.

2. âœ… Fetch data from all 8 entity endpoints
3. âœ… Write to BigQuery
4. âœ… Track sync state
5. âœ… Run scheduled syncs

**Then you can proceed with:**
- Full testing of all entities
- Deployment to Cloud Run
- Setting up Cloud Scheduler
- Running parallel with v1
