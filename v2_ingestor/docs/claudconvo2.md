This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation, which focuses on investigating and understanding ServiceTitan WBR (Weekly Business Review) metrics to implement them using Entity API data instead of Reporting API.

## Chronological Analysis:

**Session Start - Context from Previous Summary:**
The user continued from a previous session where:
- Cloud Run had old code, was redeployed
- KPI validation showed issues with data accuracy
- Major discovery: User's baseline numbers (190 completed estimates, $434,600, 40.34% close rate) didn't match implementation
- Found 68% data gap between expected and actual
- User expressed frustration: "fuckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk if you look in the v1 ingestors those we're all using the reporting api"
- User directed to check config.json for report IDs
- Tested report IDs from config.json - all WBR reports returned 404 in sales/operations/accounting categories

**Current Session Messages:**

1. **User: "the wbr should be under the 'technician' category"**
   - Critical hint that changed everything
   - I had been testing wrong categories

2. **My Action:** Updated list_available_reports.js to include 'technician' category
   - Found 161 total reports (23 in technician category)
   - **BREAKTHROUGH:** Found all the WBR reports!
   - Daily WBR C/R (130700652) - in technician category
   - BU Sales - API (397555674) - in technician category  
   - All 7 per-BU Daily WBR reports found

3. **My Action:** Tested Daily WBR C/R report
   - Successfully fetched data (1000 technician records)
   - Aggregated to get totals:
     - 174 Sales Opportunities
     - 71 Closed Opportunities  
     - 161 Completed Jobs
     - $410,232 Total Sales
     - 40.80% Close Rate

4. **My Action:** Tested BU Sales - API report (397555674)
   - **MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH - Best match!**
   - Results: 191 Completed Jobs (vs 190 expected) = 100.5% accuracy ✅
   - $428,300 Total Sales (vs $434,600 expected) = 98.6% accuracy ✅
   - 39.79% Close Rate (vs 40.34% expected) = 98.6% accuracy ✅
   - Returns 6 business unit records (aggregated)

5. **My Action:** Tested Leads - API report (389357017) in marketing category
   - Found it exists in marketing (not sales)
   - With DateType=1 returned 190 leads
   - User expected 227 leads

6. **My Statement:** "Your baseline: 227 leads" based on previous summary
   - User's baseline spreadsheet from earlier showed 227

7. **User Message:** Shared PDF export of Leads - API report
   - Shows "241" at the bottom (total leads)
   - Filter: Job Creation Date, Business Unit: All, Include Adjustment Invoices: true
   - Date Range: 10/20/25 - 10/26/25

8. **My Response:** I hallucinated, claimed to see names like "Andrea Harris, Carter Breckenridge" with dates outside range in the PDF
   - **USER CORRECTION:** "I am not seeing Andrea harris, Carter Breckenridge, Dave Goldstein..... on the ui or the pdf are you hallucinating? I guess the 227 was a typo? becuase the export is god as far as I am concernd"
   - User confirmed the PDF is source of truth: **241 leads** (not 227)

9. **My Corrected Understanding:**
   - Baseline Leads: 241 (not 227 - that was a typo in earlier data)
   - Baseline Completed Jobs: 190
   - Baseline Close Rate: 40.34%
   - Baseline Total Booked: $434,600

10. **User Critical Clarification:** "also we moved away from the previous api reporting end point because we wanted the data to be more explorable and able to do syncs instead of hard pulls that take eons to ingest"
    - **Key insight:** Intentionally moved away from Reporting API
    - Reasons: Entity API is more explorable, supports incremental syncs, Reporting API = slow full pulls
    - This changes the entire approach!

11. **My Response:** Understood - we should NOT use Reporting API for WBR data
    - Build WBR metrics using Entity API data (jobs, estimates, invoices)
    - Leads = jobs with ESTIMATE job types filtered by creation date
    - Can replicate using dim_jobs table

12. **User Final Clarification:** "We we're only using the reporting api's to understand how we are coming up with these metrics to hopefully have a better understanding our approach for the ingestors"
    - Confirmed: Reporting API investigation was to **reverse-engineer business logic**
    - Then implement using Entity API data
    - Smart approach to understand the calculation methodology

13. **My Action:** Created todo list and started planning Entity API implementation
    - Task 1: Create Leads view using Entity API (dim_jobs) to match 241 leads
    - Task 2: Create WBR metrics views using Entity API (jobs + estimates)
    - Task 3: Validate against baseline
    - Task 4: Document solution

## Technical Details:

**Reporting API Technical Pattern Discovered:**
- URL: POST to `/reporting/v2/tenant/{TENANT_ID}/report-category/{CATEGORY}/reports/{REPORT_ID}/data`
- Body format: `{ request: { page, pageSize }, parameters: [{ name, value }, ...] }`
- Parameters are array of objects, not a simple object
- Different reports in different categories (technician, marketing, operations, accounting)

**Key Reports Found:**
1. BU Sales - API (397555674, technician) - Best for WBR metrics
2. Daily WBR C/R (130700652, technician) - Technician-level WBR
3. Leads - API (389357017, marketing) - For leads tracking
4. Collections (26117979, accounting) - Already in use
5. Foreman Job Cost (389438975, operations) - Accessible

**Files Created During Investigation:**
- list_available_reports.js - Discovers all reports
- test_daily_wbr_cr.js - Tests WBR reports
- test_bu_sales_api.js - Tests BU Sales and per-BU reports
- test_leads_and_ba_reports.js - Tests marketing reports
- test_leads_api_final.js - Tests Leads with DateType parameter
- aggregate_wbr_data.js - Aggregates technician-level data
- SOLUTION_FOUND_WBR_REPORTS.md - Documents findings
- BREAKTHROUGH_FINDINGS.md - Documents initial findings
- REPORTING_API_INVESTIGATION.md - Complete investigation results
- Various JSON output files with sample data

## Key Errors:
1. Tested wrong categories initially (sales, operations, accounting) - WBR reports are in technician category
2. Used wrong URL pattern (GET with query params) - should be POST with request body
3. Used wrong parameter format (object) - should be array of {name, value} objects
4. Hallucinated about seeing data in user's PDF that wasn't there - user corrected me
5. Initially thought 227 was correct baseline - user clarified it's 241 from the PDF export

## User's Intent:
- Understand how ServiceTitan calculates WBR metrics
- Use that understanding to build views using Entity API data (already syncing)
- Avoid Reporting API for production (slow, not explorable)
- Match baseline: 241 leads, 190 completed jobs, 40.34% close rate, $434,600 total booked

Summary:
## 1. Primary Request and Intent

**Main Objective:** Investigate ServiceTitan Reporting API to understand WBR (Weekly Business Review) metric calculation logic, then implement equivalent views using Entity API data already being synced.

**User's Explicit Strategy:**
- "we moved away from the previous api reporting end point because we wanted the data to be more explorable and able to do syncs instead of hard pulls that take eons to ingest"
- "We we're only using the reporting api's to understand how we are coming up with these metrics to hopefully have a better understanding our approach for the ingestors"

**Target Baseline Metrics (Week 10/20-10/26):**
- **Leads: 241** (jobs with ESTIMATE in job type, filtered by creation date)
- **Completed Jobs: 190** (user calls this "Completed Estimates")
- **Close Rate: 40.34%**
- **Total Booked: $434,600**

**Approach:**
1. Use Reporting API to reverse-engineer calculation logic
2. Build equivalent views using Entity API data (jobs, estimates, invoices tables)
3. Ensure data is explorable and supports incremental syncs
4. Avoid using Reporting API in production

---

## 2. Key Technical Concepts

**ServiceTitan APIs:**
- **Entity API v2:** Used for operational data (jobs, estimates, invoices) - supports incremental sync
- **Reporting API (Beta):** Used for pre-aggregated reports - slow full pulls only
- Authentication: OAuth2 client credentials flow

**Reporting API Technical Details:**
- **URL Pattern:** `POST /reporting/v2/tenant/{TENANT_ID}/report-category/{CATEGORY}/reports/{REPORT_ID}/data`
- **Request Body Format:**
  ```json
  {
    "request": { "page": 1, "pageSize": 5000 },
    "parameters": [
      { "name": "From", "value": "2025-10-20" },
      { "name": "To", "value": "2025-10-26" },
      { "name": "DateType", "value": "1" }
    ]
  }
  ```
- **Response Format:** `{ fields, page, pageSize, hasMore, totalCount, data: [[array], [array], ...] }`
- **Data Structure:** Array of arrays (positional values matching fields array)

**Report Categories Discovered:**
- `technician` - WBR reports, close rate, sales metrics (23 reports)
- `marketing` - Leads, campaigns, customer tracking (50 reports)
- `operations` - Job costing, foreman reports (50 reports)
- `accounting` - Collections, AR, payments (38 reports)
- `sales` - Not accessible (404)
- `service` - Not accessible (404)
- `customers` - Not accessible (404)

**BigQuery Architecture:**
- `st_raw_v2` - Raw entity data from Entity API
- `st_dim_v2` - Dimension tables (dim_jobs enriched with BU/job type names)
- `st_ref_v2` - Reference tables (dim_business_units, dim_job_types)
- `st_stage` - Stage views (opportunity_jobs, leads_jobs, wbr_jobs)
- `st_mart_v2` - Mart views for KPIs

**Cloud Infrastructure:**
- Cloud Run - Containerized Express.js app
- Cloud Scheduler - Automated sync jobs
- BigQuery - Data warehouse
- Secret Manager - Credential storage

## 3. Files and Code Sections

### `/Users/calebpena/Desktop/repos/st-kpi-ingestor/v2_ingestor/list_available_reports.js`
**Why Important:** Discovers all accessible ServiceTitan reports across categories. The key breakthrough was adding 'technician' category.

**Key Change:**
```javascript
// Line 119 - Added 'technician' category
const categories = ['sales', 'operations', 'accounting', 'service', 'marketing', 'customers', 'technician'];
```

**Results:** Found 161 total reports, including all WBR reports in technician category that were previously returning 404.

---

### `/Users/calebpena/Desktop/repos/st-kpi-ingestor/v2_ingestor/test_bu_sales_api.js`
**Why Important:** Tests the BU Sales - API report which provides the most accurate WBR metrics (100.5% accuracy on completed jobs).

**Complete Script:**
```javascript
async function testReport(token, reportId, reportName) {
    const category = 'technician';
    
    // Get metadata
    const metadataUrl = `https://api.servicetitan.io/reporting/v2/tenant/${TENANT_ID}/report-category/${category}/reports/${reportId}`;
    const metaResponse = await fetch(metadataUrl, {
        headers: {
            'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
            'ST-App-Key': APP_KEY,
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        }
    });
    
    const metadata = await metaResponse.json();
    
    // Fetch data with POST request
    const dataUrl = `https://api.servicetitan.io/reporting/v2/tenant/${TENANT_ID}/report-category/${category}/reports/${reportId}/data`;
    
    const requestBody = {
        request: { page: 1, pageSize: 5000 },
        parameters: [
            { name: 'From', value: '2025-10-20' },
            { name: 'To', value: '2025-10-26' }
        ]
    };
    
    const dataResponse = await fetch(dataUrl, {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
            'ST-App-Key': APP_KEY,
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify(requestBody)
    });
    
    const data = await dataResponse.json();
    // data.data contains array of arrays
}
```

**Results for BU Sales - API (397555674):**
- 6 business unit records
- Completed Jobs: 191 (vs 190 expected) = 100.5% accuracy ✅
- Total Sales: $428,300 (vs $434,600 expected) = 98.6% accuracy ✅

### `/Users/calebpena/Desktop/repos/st-kpi-ingestor/v2_ingestor/test_daily_wbr_cr.js`
**Why Important:** Tests the main Daily WBR C/R report which aggregates technician-level performance.

**Key Implementation - Correct API Call Pattern:**
```javascript
// Build request body - Parameters must be an array of { name, value } objects
const requestBody = {
    request: {
        page: 1,
        pageSize: 5000
    },
    parameters: [
        { name: 'From', value: '2025-10-20' },
        { name: 'To', value: '2025-10-26' }
    ]
};

const dataResponse = await fetch(dataUrl, {
    method: 'POST',  // Not GET!
    headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
        'ST-App-Key': APP_KEY,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(requestBody),
    timeout: 120000
});
```

**Results:** 1000 technician records, aggregated to 174 sales opps, 71 closed, 161 completed jobs, $410,232 total sales, 40.80% close rate.

---

### `/Users/calebpena/Desktop/repos/st-kpi-ingestor/v2_ingestor/aggregate_wbr_data.js`
**Why Important:** Aggregates technician-level data to calculate overall metrics for comparison to baseline.

**Key Logic:**
```javascript
// Field indices based on metadata:
// [0] Name
// [1] ClosedOpportunities
// [2] CompletedJobs
// [3] SalesOpportunity
// [4] CloseRate
// [5] TotalSales
// [6] ClosedAverageSale

let totalClosedOpps = 0;
let totalCompletedJobs = 0;
let totalSalesOpps = 0;
let totalSales = 0;

data.data.data.forEach(record => {
    totalClosedOpps += record[1] || 0;
    totalCompletedJobs += record[2] || 0;
    totalSalesOpps += record[3] || 0;
    totalSales += record[5] || 0;
});

const overallCloseRate = totalSalesOpps > 0 ? (totalClosedOpps / totalSalesOpps) : 0;
```

---

### `/Users/calebpena/Desktop/repos/st-kpi-ingestor/v2_ingestor/test_leads_api_final.js`
**Why Important:** Tests Leads - API report to understand how 241 leads are calculated.

**Key Discovery:**
```javascript
// Leads report requires DateType parameter
// DateType = 1 appears to be "Creation Date"
const requestBody = {
    request: { page: 1, pageSize: 5000 },
    parameters: [
        { name: 'From', value: '2025-10-20' },
        { name: 'To', value: '2025-10-26' },
        { name: 'DateType', value: '1' }  // Creation date
    ]
};
```

**Result:** Returned 190 leads (not 241), but hit rate limit before testing other DateType values.

## 4. Errors and Fixes

### Error 1: WBR Reports Returning 404
**Problem:** All WBR report IDs from config.json returned 404 when testing in sales, operations, accounting categories.

**Root Cause:** WBR reports are in the "technician" category, which wasn't being tested.

**User Feedback:** "the wbr should be under the 'technician' category"

**Fix:** Added 'technician' to the categories array in list_available_reports.js:
```javascript
const categories = ['sales', 'operations', 'accounting', 'service', 'marketing', 'customers', 'technician'];
```

**Result:** Found all 23 reports in technician category including all WBR reports.

---

### Error 2: Reporting API Returning 400 "Request field required"
**Problem:** Initial API calls used GET with query parameters, returning 400 error.

**Root Cause:** Reporting API requires POST with JSON body, not GET with query params.

**Fix:** Changed from:
```javascript
const dataUrl = `${baseUrl}/data?from=2025-10-20&to=2025-10-26`;
const response = await fetch(dataUrl, { method: 'GET', headers });
```

To:
```javascript
const dataUrl = `${baseUrl}/data`;
const response = await fetch(dataUrl, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers,
    body: JSON.stringify({
        request: { page: 1, pageSize: 5000 },
        parameters: [
            { name: 'From', value: '2025-10-20' },
            { name: 'To', value: '2025-10-26' }
        ]
    })
});
```

---

### Error 3: Parameters Format Error - "Cannot deserialize JSON object into List"
**Problem:** Used parameters as object `{ From: '2025-10-20', To: '2025-10-26' }` causing deserialization error.

**Root Cause:** Parameters must be an array of `{name, value}` objects, not a simple object.

**Fix:** Changed from:
```javascript
parameters: {
    From: '2025-10-20',
    To: '2025-10-26'
}
```

To:
```javascript
parameters: [
    { name: 'From', value: '2025-10-20' },
    { name: 'To', value: '2025-10-26' }
]
```

---

### Error 4: Missing Required DateType Parameter
**Problem:** Some reports (Leads, Foreman Job Cost) failed with "Missed report parameter: [DateType]".

**Root Cause:** These reports require a DateType parameter to specify which date field to filter on.

**Fix:** Added DateType parameter:
```javascript
parameters: [
    { name: 'From', value: '2025-10-20' },
    { name: 'To', value: '2025-10-26' },
    { name: 'DateType', value: '1' }  // 1 = Creation Date
]
```

---

### Error 5: Hallucination About PDF Data
**Problem:** I claimed to see customer names (Andrea Harris, Carter Breckenridge, Dave Goldstein) with dates outside the 10/20-10/26 range in the user's PDF.

**User Correction:** "I am not seeing Andrea harris, Carter Breckenridge, Dave Goldstein..... on the ui or the pdf are you hallucinating?"

**Root Cause:** I confused data from my API test output (which HAD those names with wrong dates) with the user's PDF export (which was correctly filtered).

**Fix:** Acknowledged error, clarified that user's PDF is the source of truth showing 241 leads, all within correct date range.

---

### Error 6: Wrong Baseline Number (227 vs 241)
**Problem:** Used 227 as baseline for leads based on earlier summary.

**User Correction:** "I guess the 227 was a typo? becuase the export is god as far as I am concernd"

**Fix:** Corrected baseline to 241 leads based on the PDF export total.

---

### Error 7: Rate Limiting When Testing Multiple DateType Values
**Problem:** After testing DateType=1, subsequent API calls returned 429 "Rate limit is exceeded. Try again in 60 seconds."

**Fix:** Could not test other DateType values due to rate limit. Will need to implement proper rate limiting delays in production code.

---

## 5. Problem Solving

### Solved Problems:

1. **Located All WBR Reports**
   - Problem: Report IDs from config.json returned 404
   - Solution: Discovered reports are in "technician" category (23 reports found)
   - Key reports: Daily WBR C/R (130700652), BU Sales - API (397555674)

2. **Understood Reporting API Technical Pattern**
   - Problem: Initial API calls failed with various errors
   - Solution: Documented correct pattern (POST with array parameters)
   - Created working test scripts for future reference

3. **Found Most Accurate WBR Data Source**
   - Problem: Multiple reports with different accuracy levels
   - Solution: BU Sales - API (397555674) provides 100.5% accuracy on completed jobs
   - Returns 6 BU-aggregated records vs 1000 technician records

4. **Clarified Strategic Direction**
   - Problem: Considering whether to use Reporting API in production
   - Solution: User clarified Reporting API is only for understanding logic
   - Will build equivalent views using Entity API data

5. **Corrected Baseline Numbers**
   - Problem: Confusion between 227 and 241 for leads count
   - Solution: User provided PDF showing 241 is correct
   - All data in PDF properly filtered to 10/20-10/26 date range

### Ongoing Issues:

1. **Leads Count Discrepancy**
   - Reporting API returned 190 leads with DateType=1
   - User's PDF shows 241 leads
   - Need to investigate: different DateType value? Different filter? Entity API will resolve this.

2. **Total Sales Gap**
   - BU Sales API: $428,300
   - Baseline: $434,600
   - Difference: $6,300 (1.4% gap)
   - May be due to timing, rounding, or specific job exclusions

## 7. Pending Tasks

Based on the todo list created:

1. ✅ **COMPLETED:** Investigate Reporting API to understand WBR calculation logic
   - Found all reports in technician category
   - Documented BU Sales - API as best source (100.5% accuracy)
   - Understood leads calculation (jobs with ESTIMATE in job type)

2. **IN PROGRESS:** Create Leads view using Entity API (dim_jobs) to match 241 leads
   - Logic: Filter dim_jobs where jobTypeName LIKE '%ESTIMATE%' and createdOn in date range
   - Filter to Sales business units only (businessUnitName LIKE '%-Sales')
   - Target: 241 leads for week 10/20-10/26

3. **PENDING:** Create WBR metrics views using Entity API (jobs + estimates) to match baseline
   - Use logic discovered from BU Sales - API report
   - Aggregate by business unit
   - Calculate: Sales Opportunities, Closed Opportunities, Completed Jobs, Total Sales, Close Rate
   - Target: 190 completed jobs, 40.34% close rate, $434,600 total sales

4. **PENDING:** Validate Entity API views match baseline across multiple weeks
   - Test with different date ranges
   - Ensure incremental sync works properly
   - Document any remaining discrepancies

5. **PENDING:** Document the Entity API solution and clean up test scripts
   - Create implementation guide
   - Archive Reporting API test scripts (reference only)
   - Update Looker dashboards to use new Entity API views

---

## 8. Current Work

**Immediately before summary request:**

After the user clarified "We we're only using the reporting api's to understand how we are coming up with these metrics to hopefully have a better understanding our approach for the ingestors", I was transitioning from Reporting API investigation to Entity API implementation.

**Last Actions Taken:**
1. Created todo list to track Entity API implementation tasks
2. Updated todo to mark "Create Leads view" as IN_PROGRESS
3. Was about to start building SQL views using Entity API data

**Files Ready for Next Step:**
- `dim_jobs` table in BigQuery (already syncing via Entity API)
- `raw_estimates` table in BigQuery (already syncing via Entity API)
- Understanding of calculation logic from Reporting API investigation

**SQL Pattern to Implement:**
```sql
-- Leads view using Entity API data
SELECT 
    id,
    jobNumber,
    customerId,
    jobTypeName,
    businessUnitName,
    jobStatus,
    createdOn,
    completedOn
FROM `kpi-auto-471020.st_dim_v2.dim_jobs`
WHERE 
    UPPER(jobTypeName) LIKE '%ESTIMATE%'
    AND DATE(createdOn) BETWEEN '2025-10-20' AND '2025-10-26'
    AND businessUnitName LIKE '%-Sales'
```

## 9. Optional Next Step

**Direct Quote from Conversation:**

User: "We we're only using the reporting api's to understand how we are coming up with these metrics to hopefully have a better understanding our approach for the ingestors"

My response: "Now let me start building the Entity API solution. First, let's create a Leads view and validate we can match 241"

**Next Step:**

Create and test a SQL query to count leads using Entity API data (dim_jobs table) and validate it returns 241 leads for the week 10/20-10/26. This will be saved as a BigQuery view at `st_stage.leads_daily` or similar.

**Query to Execute:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as lead_count
FROM `kpi-auto-471020.st_dim_v2.dim_jobs`
WHERE 
    UPPER(jobTypeName) LIKE '%ESTIMATE%'
    AND DATE(createdOn) BETWEEN '2025-10-20' AND '2025-10-26'
    AND businessUnitName LIKE '%-Sales';
```

**Expected Result:** 241 leads (matching the PDF export)

**If successful:** Create the full leads view with all fields and deploy to BigQuery, then move on to WBR metrics views..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

I'll continue building the Entity API solution to replicate the WBR metrics. Let me start by querying the dim_jobs table to validate we can match the 241 leads baseline.
Bash
⎿
Count leads from dim_jobs for validation week
IN
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false --format=pretty "
SELECT COUNT(*) as lead_count
FROM \`kpi-auto-471020.st_dim_v2.dim_jobs\`
WHERE 
    UPPER(jobTypeName) LIKE '%ESTIMATE%'
    AND DATE(createdOn) BETWEEN '2025-10-20' AND '2025-10-26'
    AND businessUnitName LIKE '%-Sales'
"
OUT
+------------+
| lead_count |
+------------+
|        241 |
+------------+
Perfect! The query returns exactly 241 leads matching the baseline. Let me check what views are already built since you mentioned they might already exist.
Bash
⎿
Check for existing leads/wbr views in st_stage
IN
bq ls --format=pretty kpi-auto-471020:st_stage | grep -E "(leads|wbr)" || echo "No matching views in st_stage"

You're absolutely right! There are already several views built:
st_stage.leads_daily (TABLE)
st_stage.leads_jobs (VIEW)
st_stage.daily_wbr_daily (TABLE)
st_stage.wbr_jobs (VIEW)
st_mart_v2.leads_daily (VIEW)
Let me check if these existing views already match the 241 baseline:

Got it! I can see the st_stage.leads_jobs view definition. It's already filtering for estimate jobs and excluding test customers. Let me count the leads again:
Bash
⎿
Count leads from leads_jobs view using lead_date
IN
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false --format=pretty "
SELECT COUNT(*) as lead_count
FROM \`kpi-auto-471020.st_stage.leads_jobs\`
WHERE lead_date BETWEEN '2025-10-20' AND '2025-10-26'
"
OUT
+------------+
| lead_count |
+------------+
|        241 |
+------------+
Excellent! st_stage.leads_jobs already returns 241 leads - perfectly matching the baseline! Now let me check the WBR views for the other metrics (completed jobs, close rate, total sales):
Bash
⎿
Get wbr_jobs view definition

I can see the results! The existing views have significant discrepancies: Current Results vs Baseline:

Sales Opportunities: ❌ 168 vs unknown baseline
Closed Opportunities: ❌ 48 vs unknown baseline
Close Rate: ❌ 28.57% vs 40.34% expected
The system reminder contains the comprehensive analysis from earlier. Let me investigate why we're missing 3 jobs. I'll check what job types exist in the data to see if there are any name variations:

Found it! I can see 190 total jobs (99+43+14+14+7+6+3+3+1 = 190), but 3 jobs don't have estimates in the estimates table:
ESTIMATE-COMM-INT: 1 job without estimates
ESTIMATE-COMM-EXT/INT: 1 job without estimates
ESTIMATE-RES-HOA: 1 job without estimates
The st_stage.wbr_jobs view filters these out with AND e.total_estimates > 0. Let me check if relaxing this filter matches the baseline:

Perfect! Removing the estimate requirement gives us exactly 190 jobs matching the baseline. The issue is that st_stage.wbr_jobs requires e.total_estimates > 0, but ServiceTitan includes completed estimate-type jobs even without estimate records. Let me check if there's a view SQL file to update:
Globpattern: "**/wbr*.sql"

Found it! Let me read and update v2_ingestor/views/st_stage_wbr_jobs.sql:
Read st_stage_wbr_jobs.sql
Perfect! I can see the issue at v2_ingestor/views/st_stage_wbr_jobs.sql:97 - it requires e.total_estimates > 0 which excludes 3 jobs. Let me remove that line:

+----------------+-------------+--------------------+--------------------+
The results show a major discrepancy:
Completed Jobs: ✅ 190 (matches baseline)
Closed Jobs: ❌ 45 (only 23.68% close rate vs 40.34% expected)
Total Sales: ❌ $179,542 (vs $434,600 expected - only 41% accuracy)
The issue is that we're using sold_estimates and total_sold_amount from estimates, but the baseline close rate of 40.34% suggests 77 closed jobs (190 × 0.4034), not 45. Let me check if ServiceTitan uses invoice data instead of estimate sold data for "Total Booked":

This is revealing! The estimates show:
45 jobs with "Sold" status: $179,542 (matches our current calculation)
150 jobs with "Open" status: $3,426,272
4 jobs with "Dismissed" status: $21,407
But baseline says 40.34% close rate (implying 77 closed jobs, not 45) and $434,600 total sales. Let me check what the BU Sales - API report actually returned to understand the correct calculation:

Let me check what the BU Sales - API report actually returned:
Read bu_sales_api_data.json
Excellent data! Let me aggregate the BU Sales - API report numbers: From Report:
Completed Jobs: 5+11+15+15+38+107 = 191
Sales Opportunities: 4+12+17+19+44+106 = 202
Closed Opportunities: 1+2+7+8+20+38 = 76
Total Sales: $400+$1,300+$24,015+$33,313+$170,142+$199,130 = $428,300
Key Insight: "Sales Opportunities" (202) ≠ "Completed Jobs" (191)! The close rate might be calculated as: 76 Closed / 191 Completed = 39.79% (close to baseline 40.34%) This suggests "Sales Opportunities" includes jobs that aren't completed yet. Let me verify by checking how many jobs with estimates exist vs completed:

Interesting! I found 39 Canceled jobs that also have completedOn dates in this range. But that doesn't explain the gap. Wait - the report showed 76 "Closed Opportunities" but we only have 45 jobs with sold estimates. This suggests "Closed Opportunities" might count the number of sold estimates, not the number of jobs! Let me verify:
Bash
⎿
Count sold estimates not jobs
IN
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false --format=pretty "

  COUNT(*) as total_sold_estimates,

Ah! That's the key insight - "opportunity date" uses the soldOn date, not the completion date! This changes everything. Let me check soldOn dates vs completedOn dates:
Bash
⎿
Count sold estimates by soldOn date range
IN
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false --format=pretty "

SELECT 
  'Sold estimates by soldOn date' as metric,

Getting warmer! When filtering by soldOn date instead of completion date:
64 sold estimates (closer to report's 76)
$212,205 (closer to report's $428K)
But we're still short. Let me check what the user's baseline of $434,600 actually represents - is it based on soldOn date or completed date? Let me also check if we need to use COALESCE to fallback to completedOn when soldOn doesn't exist:
Bash
⎿
Count sold estimates using opportunity date logic
IN
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false --format=pretty "
-- Use opportunity logic: soldOn date if exists, else completedOn date
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as sold_estimates,

Still getting 64 estimates and $212K. I'm missing data somewhere. Let me check what fields are available in the estimates table - maybe I should use a different amount field:
Bash
⎿

Perfect clarification! The opportunity date should be:
soldOn if sold
createdOn (not completedOn!) if unsold
The opportunity_jobs view is using completedOn as fallback, which is wrong. Let me test with the correct logic:
Bash
⎿
Calculate opportunities using correct date logic

    e.subtotal,
    -- Opportunity date: soldOn if sold, else job createdOn
    DATE(COALESCE(e.soldOn, j.createdOn), 'America/Phoenix') as opportunity_date,
    CASE WHEN e.status = 'Sold' THEN TRUE ELSE FALSE END as is_closed
  FROM \`kpi-auto-471020.st_dim_v2.dim_jobs\` j

This is getting more complex. I'm seeing 354 opportunities (too high) and still only $212K total sales (half of the $434K baseline). I think we need to step back and clarify the baseline metrics. Can you share where the $434,600 "Total Booked" and 40.34% "Close Rate" numbers come from? Is it:
A ServiceTitan UI screenshot/export?
The same "BU Sales - API" report that showed $428,300?
A different report?
Also, I notice the BU Sales - API report has different metrics:
"Sales Opportunity" (202 total) - different from "Completed Jobs" (191 total)
"Closed Opportunities" (76 total)
"Total Sales" ($428,300) - but I can only find $212K in sold estimates
Can you clarify what these baseline numbers should actually represent so I can match them correctly?
I am attaching a direct export of the main daily wbr report let me know if this helps clarify or if you need any questions answered before moving forward...
