  AND jobStatus = 'Completed' -- Or whatever indicates completion
GROUP BY businessUnitName
```

### 7. Success Rate (Close Rate)
**Report:** *Daily WBR C/R*
**Filters:** Same as Total Booked

**Calculation:** Average of "Close Rate" Column

**BigQuery Mapping:**
```sql
-- This likely needs estimates table to see sold vs not sold
SELECT
  businessUnitName,
  AVG(CASE WHEN e.status = 'Sold' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100 as close_rate
FROM `st_raw_v2.raw_jobs` j

    businessUnitName,
    SUM(jobs_total_cost) as warranty_cost
  FROM `st_raw_v2.raw_jobs`
  WHERE
    DATE(startDate) BETWEEN @start_date AND @end_date
    AND businessUnitName IN ('Andy''s Painting-Production', ...)
    AND jobType IN ('Warranty', 'Touchup')
  GROUP BY businessUnitName
),
produced AS (
  SELECT
    businessUnitName,
    SUM(jobs_subtotal) as dollars_produced
  FROM `st_raw_v2.raw_jobs`
  WHERE
    DATE(startDate) BETWEEN @start_date AND @end_date
    AND businessUnitName IN ('Andy''s Painting-Production', ...)
    AND jobType NOT IN ('PM Inspection', 'Safety Inspection', 'Window/Solar Washing')
  GROUP BY businessUnitName
)
SELECT
  w.businessUnitName,
  (w.warranty_cost / NULLIF(p.dollars_produced, 0)) * 100 as warranty_pct

```

### 10. Outstanding A/R

**Filters:**
- Location Name: Is not "Name"
- Net Amount: >= $10
- Business Unit: [Each production BU separately]

**Calculation:** Sum of "Net Amount" Column

**BigQuery Mapping:**
```sql
-- Need to check if invoices table has outstanding balances
-- Or if there's a separate AR field
SELECT
  businessUnitName,
  SUM(net_amount) as outstanding_ar
FROM `st_raw_v2.raw_invoices`
WHERE
  locationName != 'Name'
  AND net_amount >= 10
  AND businessUnitName IN ('Andy''s Painting-Production', ...)
  AND balance > 0 -- Still has outstanding balance
GROUP BY businessUnitName
```

## Data Gaps to Investigate

1. **Jobs Subtotal** - Need to verify this field exists in raw_jobs
2. **Jobs Total Cost** - Need to verify this field exists in raw_jobs
3. **Jobs Gross Margin %** - May need to calculate or verify field name
4. **Close Rate** - Need to understand how estimates track sold/not sold status
5. **Net Amount** - Need to verify field in invoices table for A/R
6. **Business Unit Mapping** - Need to handle Phoenix + Z-DO NOT USE combinations

## Next Steps

1. Inspect actual schema of raw_jobs, raw_estimates, raw_invoices tables
2. Create reference table for business unit mappings (including combined units)
3. Create reference table for job type filters (estimate types, excluded types)
4. Build KPI mart views with all calculations
5. Validate against actual ServiceTitan report outputs
